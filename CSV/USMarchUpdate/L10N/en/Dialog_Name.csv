now! Give it to me!"
186,Pan,"Hey, you.
Were you well known
on Talking Island?"
187,@186,"Meow? You’re in
the Silverlight
Mercenaries? Woah!
Let’s be friends!"
188,@186,"Even so, nothing is
free! Hmm... I’ll consider
it for 2 favors!"

those we can capture!"
190,Augel,"W-who are you and
what is all this!?"

someone help us!"
195,Aymel,"Pardon me. It’s been
so hectic and I
haven’t been able to
introduce myself yet!"
196,@195,"I’m Aymel. Like you,
I’m one of the
Silverlight Mercenaries!"
197,@195,"But how did you know
that I was here?
Hmm? Russel?"
198,@195,"I guess that meathead
did something right
this time. Haha!"
199,@195,"I’m chasing after a witch
whose name is
Elizabeth. You probably
know who she is..."
200,@195,"Please let me know
if you find her.
I have a debt to repay!"
204,Gludin Soldier,"I-it’s the undead!
The relic! We’ve got
to protect the relic!"
205,Pirate Navigator,"Hand over the relic
if you don’t want
to be harmed!"
206,Jack,"Argh!
I’ll turn you into
fish food!"
207,Helena,"Turn back because
it’s too dangerous?
How could I!"
208,@207,"My base has been a
mess ever since that
gloomy person came!"
209,@207,"I’ll have to get a
look of that face!"
210,@207,"You’ll keep me safe
even if a battle
occurs, right?
Maybe not...?"
211,@112,"Seems Eleanor’s
important friend
has disappeared!"
212,@112,"We’ll definitely
find her friend!
Let’s spread out
and look around!"
213,@112,"Huh?
The smell is drawing
the bats here!
Be careful!"
214,@112,"Let’s head to the
main street for now!
I sincerely hope that
she’s alright...!"
215,@112,"She said she was looking
for something precious
so she wouldn’t have
left the graveyard!"
216,@112,"Let’s head north of the
graveyard!"
217,Guard Byron,"Russel is over
here! Follow the road
and come here!"
218,@217,"It’s a huge relief
you two helped us
in this case of a missing person."
219,@217,"To be frank, I’m
scared of
investigating gloomy
places by myself!"
220,@112,"A-arghh!
W-what is this!"
221,@217,"It’s dangerous!
Unfortunately, we
need to take
care of this all!"
222,@112,"Look for a girl
named Aymel
when you arrive!"
223,@112,"She’s a Silverlight
Mercenary who was
sent out early on!"
224,Kidnapped Townsperson,"I don’t want to stay
here any longer!
Let’s go already!"

Where do you think
you’re trying to
enter?"

A little rat
has snuck in!
Kill it!"
231,Billy,"Were you feeble
things hiding
over here? Hehe."
232,@231,"Hiding it will do you
no good. Hand over
the Holy Artifact!
You fools!"
233,Forde,"You’re crazy if you
think I’ll have it
stolen a second
time! Go on, give it a try!"
234,@231,"Say goodbye to
your lower half!
You fool!"
236,@233,"Defeat the skeleton
soldiers and join
up with the
reinforcements!"
1257,Plunder Captain Kanum,"Haha. I see you’ve
come here alone."

my men!"

blocking the road!"

the axemen first."
1271,Bolt,We... we’re alive!
1284,Ol Mahum Axeman,"The prisoner
is running away!
Catch the prisoner!"
2289,Varot,Venga is over there! Go on! Today is the day he dies!
2290,@2289,Be careful! Drat! Venga noticed!
2291,@2289,"It’s Venga’s lackeys!
Be careful! Venga might slip away!"

Now we only need to put him down!
Be careful with the leather!"

Die, weakling!"
2309,Laurel,We’ve found it. Seems they are crowding together over there.
2310,@2309,"There should be a suspicious object over there!
Please bring it here!"
2311,Voldiac,"Oh ho. Here’s an object I didn’t even imagine I’d see.
That’s not something you should be touching so rashly."
2312,@2311,Pay the price of your curiosity.
2313,Zarin,We’ve received word that Jackal has been sighted at a post to the north!
2314,@2313,There’s no time! Defeat him quickly before it runs away!
2315,Jackal,"Hahaha, seems you have a death wish.

We thought we
were going to die!"

I’ll skewer you with
this spear!"
241,Rescued Elderly Man,"T-thank you!
There are others if
you head to the right!"

Did you perhaps

out of here quick!"
245,Sharpshooter,"You really want to
die, don’t you!
You inferior race!"

ritual on your own!
This is digging
your own grave!"

descendants of
the dragon race!"

He promised
the land of Gludio
to us! Be gone!"

Today is the day I
kill you!"
255,Elizabeth,"Oh young miss,
you’re still alive?"
256,@255,"You should’ve just died.
Perhaps you should
deal with the Orcs
before you deal with me?"
257,@255,"You’ll have to kiss
your life goodbye if
you intrude in our
plan again."
258,@255,"It’s been so long!
You can’t just
leave like that!
Hahahaha!"
272,Karin,"H-help!
They’re coming
to abduct me!"

Bring back a good
sword as a present
if you find one!"
275,@195,"Ugh, that meathead.
I’ll see you later
Theodore!"
276,@195,"Huh? You’re wondering
if Theodore is too
curt?"
277,@195,"Haha. There’s a
reason for that. He’s
trying to not get close to you."
278,@195,"I’ll tell you an old
story. You’ve heard
of the Legend of
Valdir, right?"
279,@195,"The story of Valdir
and the Silverlight
Mercenaries who
defeated Kengpyn
and Marlow."
280,@195,"In fact, Kengpyn and
Marlow were once a
part of the
Silverlight Mercenaries."
281,@195,"They were two of
the best until they
were taken in
by the darkness..."
282,@195,"Theodore recommended
those two to
the mercenary troops."
283,@195,"Theodore didn’t
participate in the
siege of the
Aden Castle."
284,@195,"No... he couldn’t.
He couldn’t bring himself
to kill his friends...
Then after that, he..."
285,@195,"He stopped investing
in people. But
strangely enough, he
seems to trust you."
286,@195,"If it’s you,
you could
turn Theodore back
into his old self."
287,@195,"I’ve taken care of
everything! I’ll
keep watch,
you open the prison!"
288,West Blood Ranger,"T-thank you!
Please take care of
the other members as well!"
289,@160,"Darn it! Am I
late?! Aymel!
Is Aymel alright?"
290,Keshupone,"Let’s head to the
entrance! We need
to make preparations
before they get here!"
291,Monster Exterminator,"The bugbears
are rushing in!!!"
292,@290,"Stop them!!!
The town will be
endangered if we
are defeated!!!"

310,@309,"This is
to avenge my
younger brother!"
311,@309,"I’ll crush you all
to pieces!"

Reuenthal
was caught?"
313,@312,"Well, such things
don’t matter. Hehe."
314,@312,"I’ll kill you to end
the guardian contract
and become free!"

Blood will bless
us all!!"
325,Ranger Hexor,"Drat!
These bugbears!"
326,@325,"The bugbears have
caught scent of
the platoon members."
327,@325,"They’re all
crowding in
that direction!"
328,@325,"I’m concerned about
the squad members!"
329,@325,Let’s hurry!
1204,@325,"It’s the chancellor
himself! We’re saved!"
1272,Faute,"Bakum is in the
inner regions of the colony!"
1273,@1272,"You’ll need to defeat
fighters to reach
all the way there!"

me?"
1275,@1274,"You, an insignificant,
dare to challenge me?"
1276,@1274,You’ll pay the price for your arrogance!
1279,Tukan,"Which one is causing
this ruckus!"
1280,@1279,"How dare you
interrupt me!"
1281,@1279,Witness my rage!
1287,Gludio Guard,"Ahhh!!!
Save us.
Please save us!!!"
1288,Schringer,Who are you?!
1830,@1288,"Can you fight evenly against
my dogs?"
1831,@1288,"Sic him, men!"
1562,@1274,"Seems to be
another guy
Faute sent."
1563,@1274,"Have you lost
your mind? Get him!"
1564,@2309,"The first tree
is southeast
of here."
1565,@2309,"There’s not
a moment to spare.
Please hurry."
1566,Dungeon Skeleton Soldier,"This tree
gives us strength!"
1567,@1566,"Get the guy who burned
the tree!"

is northward
of there."
1573,@2309,"It’s finally the last one.
Please hurry!"
2418,@2294,Over there! There!
2419,@2294,The lizardmen seem to have their mind occupied with something else! Hurry hurry!
2420,Maille Lizardman Pillager,Intruder!
2421,@2420,"You dare to touch our stuff?!
Kill! Kill!"
2422,Mato,This is terrific. I was running short on money.
2423,@2422,Grab them!!!
2424,@2313,"We’ve received word that Kaba, the lord of red bears, has been found!"
2425,@2313,Whoever catches him will be given a huge reward!
2426,@2313,Go!
2427,@2313,Th-they...!
2428,@2313,An even greater reward will be given to whoever defeats them!
2429,@2313,It’s coming! Don’t let Kaba get away!
2430,Hamon,Yes! Let’s get out of here! I don’t want to be here even a moment longer!
2431,@2430,Be merciless in defeating those who rush in!
2432,@2430,Die! Die you all!
2433,@2430,H-he’s finally out!
2434,@2430,Ah..! He is...!
2435,@2430,He’s the one who killed our comrades...
2436,@2430,This is all over...
2437,Mitchell,Great! Then let’s defeat the raiders first!
2438,@2437,"It wouldn’t be wise to simply walk into a place that’s swarming with them, right?"
2439,@2437,Over there! The weapons are over there! Let’s burn them before they come rushing in!
2767,Maille Lizardman Trooper,Shh! Who is that!
2440,@2437,They’re coming! Be careful!
2768,@2767,Over here! Catch them!
2441,@2437,"Captain...!
You must’ve lost!
He’s someone we must defeat!"
2442,Sara Ra,Hmm. The shamans don’t seem to have it.
2443,@2442,There are suspicious boxes over there! Could you check them out?
2444,@2442,"Great! This scroll seems to be proper!
Ah, they’re rushing in as expected!"
2445,@2442,"Maybe they have something to hide?
Let’s defeat them quickly and get away!"
2446,Kuata,Grab them! Don’t let those thieves get away!
2447,@2446,"How dare you try to steal the scroll!
We’ll make this place your final resting places!"
2448,@1272,Come here! To think the sharpshooter Kariana was here...
2449,@1272,Our soldiers are dying!!!
2450,Gludio Soldier,"Ahhh...
S-save us!!!"
2451,@2450,Ah! D-don’t shoot!
2452,Kariana,Wahaha. How fun.
2453,@2452,"How dare you covet our land!
As long as I’m here, you will die before your comrades arrive!"
2454,@2450,Uh... Are we... alive?
2455,@2450,@2409
2456,@2430,Please defeat the bugbear first!
2457,@2430,We burn with rage when we think of our comrades who were killed by them.
2458,@2430,Please defeat Dark Weavers!
2459,@2430,Be cautious of the strange magic Dark Weavers use!
2460,@2430,"Arghh! They’re after me!
Help me!"
2461,@2430,Leave it to me!
2462,@2430,I’ll get rid of you before I die!
2463,@2430,@2300
2464,@2313,Where did Kaba go?!
2759,@1272,Wait a minute. I think that’s Tukan over there. Let’s head over there.
2760,Turek Orc Fighter,Hehehe. It’s you? The one who has been lurking around this region?
2761,@2760,Don’t think you’ll be getting out of here alive!
2762,@1272,Uh oh! It’s a trap!
2763,@1272,Let out of there quickly!
2764,@1287,@1287
2765,@1287,W-wait!! Don’t come this way!
2766,@1287,Shriek!
337,Dark Acolyte,"More sacrificial bugs
have appeared!"
338,@337,"Wahaha!
Ahahaha!
You’ll make a
great sacrifice!"
1410,Skeleton,Hehehehe!!!
1411,Latos,Look! They’re coming!
1412,@1411,"The skeletons just
keep coming to life!"
1413,@1411,"The skeletons will
collapse if we defeat
the Dark Brotherhood!"
1414,@1411,"Eliminate the
Dark Brotherhood!"
1415,@1411,@1413
1416,@1411,@1414
339,Southern Troop Commandant,"Be careful! We’ve
been spotted!"
340,@337,"How dare you touch
the cauldron?!
Damn you all!"
341,@337,"Soul Slasher!
Consume them -
and their souls!"
342,@337,"I’ll show you the
fruit of our labor!
Giant Skeleton!"
343,@337,"You all!
No one leaves
here alive!"
344,@339,"We’ve almost restored
peace to Windawood!
Destroy the enemies!"
345,@339,"Reinforcements are here.
Trust our allies and fight on!"
346,@337,"Looks like none of you
have gotten a grip!
Die!"
347,@339,"I see the
Giant Skeleton!
Brace yourselves!"
348,@339,"Defeat him, and
victory will be ours!!!"
349,@339,"We must destroy the
Dark Brotherhood!"
1588,The Amnesiac,"I feel like I’ve
forgotten something..."
1589,@1588,"Something about here...
Seems familiar..."
1590,@1588,"I feel like maybe
I’ll remember after
crossing this bridge..."
1591,Angie,"Are you alright?
This is definitely where Elves and Demons
fought in the past..."
1592,@1591,"Hmm... What was it...?
Vapar? Oh, yeah!"
1593,@1591,"An ancient Demon
was sealed here."
1594,@1591,"I have a bad feeling
about this..."
350,@1588,"Huff. Huff.
My head feels like
it’s gonna explode..."
351,@1588,"Spiders?! Augh!
Stop them!"
352,@1588,"Why are these
guys attacking
me..."
360,Turek Orc,Humans! Catch them!
361,@360,"We must teach
them a lesson!
Destroy them!"
362,@360,"I’ll show you
my Orcish strength!
Feeble Human!"
363,Kail,"We’re helpless
against this swarm of Orcs."
364,@363,Defeat them quickly.
365,@363,"There are too many
war machines."
366,@363,"That’s impossible
without the
help of humans."
367,@363,"Someone is trying
to start a war."
368,@363,"You must uncover
the troublemaker’s
identity!"
369,@363,Prepare yourself!
370,@360,"I smell
filthy Humans!
Kill all Humans!"
371,Duvalte,"If we die,
this whole operation
is ruined!"
372,@371,Don’t die!
377,Aurora,"The reinforcements
aren’t here yet?"
378,Blood Ranger Soldier,"Not yet, sir!
The soldier that
went to deliver the
message- Argh!"
379,@360,"Kill them all!
Tonight,
we feast!"
380,@377,"Argh!
I see... the light..."
381,@1591,"This is where Orcs
and Elves fought
long ago."
382,@1591,"Hmm... why is there
large-scale mind
control activity here?"
383,@1591,"Everything about this
is suspicious...
And this energy-"
384,@1591,"Why is there dark
energy concentrated
over there?"
385,@1591,"Hurry - let’s go!
I feel like
something bad is
about to happen!"
388,Blood Ranger Captain,"There are more
coming than we
expected! Everyone,
prepare for battle!"
389,@1411,"I hope
they’re alive..."
390,@1411,"Just thinking back
to when we were
attacked still gives
me goosebumps."
391,@1411,"There!
We’re almost there!"
392,@1411,"All the missing
people are gone
because of the
Dark Brotherhood."
393,@1411,"They’re collecting
Human bones
to summon
Skeleton Soldiers."
394,@1411,"This is where they
do their research.
Production happens
by the ruins."
395,Carlze,"To think such a
thing was happening
here..."
396,@395,"They’ve been using
the cauldron to make
Skeleton Soldiers!"
397,@395,"It was a
truly horrific
sight to behold."
398,@395,"Let’s hurry! We
must put an end
to this wrongdoing!"
399,@1591,"It’s such a relief
having a famous
mercenary here!"
400,@1591,"I just happened
to be worrying
about how to get there."
401,@1591,"The battle against
the Ol Mahum is
raging in front of here."
402,@1591,"They are so
incredibly greedy..."
403,@1591,"They’ve been coming
from all over since
word got out about
the rare crystals."
404,@1591,"Well, I’m going
because of my
interest in
Mana Crystals."
405,@1591,"If it wasn’t for
the Crystals,
I really wouldn’t want to go."
406,@1591,"But having something
to research is
truly a blessing!"
407,@363,"The Silverlight
Mercenaries?
What a relief!"
408,@363,"The operation
must succeed."
409,@363,"The Orc invasion
will be upon us soon."
1595,@1591,"We must stop Valter!
Drat! I can’t believe
I didn’t notice!"
1596,@1591,"It’s all over if the
Demon wakes up!
We must stop him."
1597,Valter,Wahahaha... Finally!!!
1598,@1597,"Argh! Please stop me...
I can’t control my body!"
1599,Possessed Valter,"Over he-! Shut up, you!
Revive me already!"
1600,@1591,Over there! Hurry!
1601,@1599,"Do not disturb the
ritual!"
1602,@1599,"Demons, attack him!"
1603,@1597,"Argh!!! Please!
Stop them!"
1604,@1597,He’s incomplete!
1605,Vapar,"Valter... You...!
No matter! I’ll kill
you all!"
427,Soldier,"The Warchief!!!
The Orc Warchief
is here!!!"
428,@377,"Let’s go!
We must defeat
the Warchief!"
429,Miles,"Hang in there!
The fate of
Windawood is in
our hands!"
430,@377,"The Orc Warchief
was resurrected!
But- how?!"
431,Hardin,"That dark Soulstone
stores souls using
dark energy."
432,@431,"Then, it corrupts
the soul with dark
magic and consumes
the target."
433,@431,"However, if it isn’t
destroyed, it will gain
a body that neither
ages nor dies!"
434,@431,"I can only assume
that the Orc Warchief
will soon be reborn
with that Soulstone!"
435,@431,"Protect me
while I destroy
the Soulstone!"
436,@431,Ha...
437,@431,"Ugh! The Soulstone’s
dark energy is
attacking me!"
438,@431,"Exactly how many
souls are
trapped here?"
439,@431,"If I’m not careful,
then I too may
be swallowed up!"
440,@431,How did this happen?!
441,@431,"The deceased Orc
Warchief was
captured and
consumed."
442,@431,"We must
defeat him!!!"
447,@427,Argh!
448,@427,H-Help us!!!
449,Rabid Crawler,"Humans!
Kill Humans!"
450,@449,"This will be
your grave!"
451,@449,Die! Die!
1536,@427,"Thank you so much
for your help!"
1537,@427,"We must meet
back up with Russel."
1538,@427,Come with us!
452,@112,Uh oh! YOU!!!
453,@112,"You want to have
a go at it?!
Bring it on!"
454,@112,"Haha!
You guys are
full of energy!"
455,Horkan,"Haha! I’m pumped up
and ready to go!"
456,@455,"I heard that
you’ve been
picking on my guys!"
457,@455,"I’m going to
bring you down!"
1545,@112,"Ha! Tough talking for
a mutt!"
1546,@455,Mutt?! We’re not mutts!
1547,@455,"All of the crystals here
are ours!"
1548,@455,@2300
458,@112,"Hey! Don’t take
those crystals!"
459,@112,"I need to make
a living!"
460,@455,"Woof woof!
Kill! Kill!!!"
461,Right-hand Man Qupown,"Hehe! Take him
to meet him!"
462,@461,"Don’t interrupt
us!"
463,@461,Shrieeek!!!
464,@461,"I’ll send you
to hell!!!"
465,"Riley, Mother of War Hounds",Woof! Woof!
466,@465,"Woof woof
woof woof!!!"
1609,@427,"Woah! Is this a dog
or a wolf?! Sheesh!"
1610,@427,"Such a large war
hound!!!"
1312,Psy,"I can feel the statues’
Mana from here."
1507,@1312,"You must defeat
Kekoon and the Orcs,
then retrieve the Statue."
1313,Kekoon,"What are you doing?
Take care of him
already!"
1315,Mammon,"Finally!
I! Am! Free!!!"
1316,@1313,"Hehehehe.
Mammon is finally free!"
1317,@1313,"You guys are
done for!"
1318,@1312,"Mammon?!
Has the statue’s seal
been broken?"
1319,@1312,"We must stop him!
Mammon cannot
be released!"
1320,@1315,"Hehe.
Let me have a
taste of this world, too!"
1321,@1315,"If you aim to kill me,
then you leave me no choice!"
1322,@1315,"I’ll have to
kill you all!"
1323,Orc,Intruder! Intruder!
1324,@1323,Get them!
1325,@1323,"Our sacrifices to Kekoon
are running away!"
1510,Darian,"Korum!
I finally found you.
You’ll die at my hands!"
1330,Korum,"What is it this time?
You’re boring me.
Deal with it yourself."
1327,@1330,"Hahaha.
For one so weak,
you put up quite a struggle!"
1329,@1330,"How dare you
challenge me?
I’ll take care of you myself."
1417,Habeth the Murderer,"Nice. Here’s another
one!"
1418,@1417,"One more sacrifice
we can offer to him!"
1419,@1417,"Risking your life for
a measly gulp of water?
Hehehe..."
1420,@1417,Fools!
1421,@1417,"You think you can face
off against my children?"
1539,@337,"Do you really think
you can fight
against this subject?"
1540,@337,"You should be
honored to face
our masterpiece!"
1541,@337,Do not despair!
1542,@337,"You’ll be absorbed
soon!"
1543,@337,Wahahaha!!!
1544,@337,"Why isn’t Habeth back
yet?!"
1582,Kookan,Get him!
1583,@1582,How dare you destroy the signal fire and try to run!
1584,@1582,I’ll rip you to shreds!
1585,@1582,"I, Kookan, will deal with you myself!"
1586,@377,They’re coming!
1587,@377,Uh oh! Get out of there - fast!
2318,Dorothy,"The ruins up
there seem
most suspicious."
2319,@2318,"Strangely enough,
monsters are
gathering over there."
2320,@2318,"Let’s deal with the
war hounds first, and
then we can investigate."
2321,@2318,"There’s a shiny
box over there!"
2322,@2318,"There’s no doubt about it!
The Elf’s Treasure
should be there!"
2323,@2318,"Look at these sparkling
gemstones! Alright!!!"
2324,Fraille,"Muhaha!
Hand over the
gemstones, please!"
2325,@2318,Who are you?!
2326,@2324,"That’s none of your concern.
Just hand over
the gemstones."
2327,@2318,That’s hilarious!
2328,@2324,"Men, get him!"
2329,@2318,"Stop him!
I’ll pay you double!"
2335,@2318,"Huh?
There’s nothing here!"
2336,@2318,"Wah!
War hounds!
Watch out!"
2337,@2318,"I think we’re
in too deep!"
2338,@2442,"Nice! I think we’ve found it!
There’s a cage over
there in the ruins."
2339,@2442,"Hurry!
We may not
have any time!"
2340,Kidnapped Townsfolk,"How did
you get here?!
Oh, Einhasad!!!"
2341,@2340,"A man wearing a
dark scarf abducted
the people!"
2342,@2340,"I don’t want to be here
for even a minute!"
2343,@2340,"Hurry!!!
Let’s leave!!!"
2344,@2340,"Skeletons!!!
They’re chasing us!"
2345,Bezz,"My, my, my.
It would be a shame
to lose such valuable subjects, wouldn’t it?"
2346,@2345,"There are still so many
experiments to do."
2347,@2340,"Th-that guy!
Careful!"
2348,@2345,"The more test
subjects I have,
the better!"
2349,@2345,@2300
2357,@2289,"Teach these guys
a lesson! Meow!"
2358,@2289,"O-over there!
Our belongings are there!
Get them back! Meow!"
2360,Lokita,"Lookie here!
If it isn’t you cat brats!"
2361,@2360,"Have you come
to offer us a bribe?
Hahaha."
2362,@2360,"Hey, men!
Catch him and kill him!"
2363,@2360,"Seems you’ve brought
trusty backup!
I’ll deal with it myself!"
2365,Ol Mahum,Thief!!! Get him!
2366,@2289,"A thief?!
I’m just taking
back my stuff!"
2367,@2289,"Mercenary, get
rid of him!"
2368,Arche,"There!
What’s that
huge gemstone?"
2369,@2368,"I sense some
incredible Mana!
Please bring me that, too!"
2370,@2365,"Thief!
Thief!
Thief!"
2371,@2365,"Get him!
We must not lose
the crystal!"
2372,Canu,"Who dares
to touch
what’s ours?!"
2373,@2372,"You will pay for your
rash actions with your life!"
2374,Farlon,"Those Ruin Remnants fetch
quite a high price as well!"
2375,@2374,"Can you
help us?"
2376,@2374,"Oh, my!
There are quite a few monsters!
Be careful!"
2377,Qupown,"Squaaaawk!
Who dares to
lay hand on
the relic?"
2378,@2377,"Die!
Die!"
2379,@2377,"You’re just like
all the others!"
2380,@2377,"You’ll die here
by my hands!"
2381,@2374,"We found a suspicious
box over there!"
2382,@2374,@2375
2383,@2374,"Whoa!
It’s a trap!
Be careful!"
2384,Prima,"Ahha! Got you!
Kill them!"
2385,@2384,"How dare you look
for the Elf’s Treasure?!
Hehehe."
2386,@2384,"Your soul will be
a perfect sacrifice!"
2387,Azir,"Nice!
That took care of the monsters!
Shall we get to investigating?"
2388,@2387,"Just in case, though...
Protect me if the
monsters come back."
2389,@2387,"Whoa, what’s this?!"
2390,@2387,"Woohoo!
What luck!
Feldheim’ll be thrilled!"
2391,@2387,"Hmm?
What happened?"
2392,@2387,"Huh? What’s this?
Oops!
Does it seem like something’s missing?"
2393,@2387,"Whoa.
Whoaaaaa.
That!!! What is that?"
2394,@2387,"Did I hear
incorrectly?"
2395,@2387,"Hurry!!!
Deal with
them quickly!"
2396,@2387,"Hmm.
Is there anything useful here?"
2397,@2387,I don’t see anything.
2398,@2387,"We need to find something
useful to satisfy Feldheim."
2399,@2387,"Haha.
It sure is noisy.
Could you quiet down a bit?"
2400,@2387,"Sigh.
Will I ever find
even one relic?"
2401,@1510,"The troopers are
a big problem!"
2402,@1510,"There’s no time!
Deal with them quickly!"
2403,@1510,"There’s still time!
Hurry!
Rescue the hostages!"
2404,@2340,"Kurk will be here soon!
Hurry!!!
Get out of here!"
2405,@1510,"Oh no!
They’re coming!
I’ll take the lead!
Follow me!"
2406,Kurk,"How dare you
take my slaves?!
Die!"
2407,@1510,"Oh no!
It’s Kurk!
This will be tough!
Be careful!"
474,Mysterious Elder,"We’re under attack
by Armored Ants!
Save us!!! Arghh!"
475,Tiana,"This desert is very
important for the
Trade Route."
476,@475,"But it’s so
dangerous that it’s
difficult for any
caravan to cross."
477,@475,"Currently, only the
Staris caravan uses
it. Damn them!"
478,@475,"If it weren’t for
the Staris camp, our
caravan could claim
trade rights here."
479,@475,"That old
man needs
to die already."
480,@475,"Would you
kill Staris?"
481,@475,Haha! Just kidding!
487,@160,"In the past, when
the Empire ruled,
there was a wizard
named Beleth."
488,@160,"He was one of
the most powerful
Humans of all time."
489,@160,"Carried away by his
own power, he sought
to conquer the
entire continent."
490,@160,"Recognizing the
threat, the Empire
and Ivory Tower
combined their
strength"
491,@160,"to seal
Beleth."
492,@160,"The dark wizard
Beleth was sealed
in the Wasteland."
493,Emon,"I see the statue was
broken recently."
494,@493,"Ah ha.
I understand
why it broke."
495,@493,"I need to check
one more thing."
498,@493,"A... ah!
The Basilisk?!"
499,@493,Be careful!!!
500,@493,"Oh... no... I
sprayed some
medicine, but the
dark magic energy..."
501,@493,"It’s difficult to
completely block
out dark energy..."
502,@493,"Fortunately,
there are merchants
gathered near here."
503,@493,"Let’s quicken
our pace."
510,Valley Watcher,"Hmph! The small
fries of Ivory Tower."
511,Edina,"Hmm? I’m losing
my strength!
What’s happening?"
1205,@510,"Ivory Tower fools!
You will all die!"
1206,@511,"My strength...
It’s gone!"
1207,@511,"My Mana...
It’s evaporated!"
1208,@511,Could this bag...?
512,Staris,"What in the world...
How could something
like this..."
513,@512,"It’s shocking to see
the Ol Mahum in a
fratricidal war..."
514,@512,"I can’t believe the
valley rocks fell
so suddenly..."
515,@512,"Whoa!
Be careful!!!"
520,Old Man who Almost Died,"I owe a great
debt to you..."
521,@520,"Things were hectic
earlier, but thank you."
522,@512,"I am Staris.
I own this place."
1209,@131,"Got you!
Ivory Tower Wizard!
I’ll rip you to shreds!"
1210,@511,"Oh, my goodness!
Where did these
werewolves come from?!"
1211,@511,Do something!!!
1212,@131,"Over there!
It’s the brat from
the Ivory Tower!"
1213,@511,"Huh? Again?
He’s chasing us!
Why is he doing that?!"
1214,@510,"We cannot let her
live. Kill the wizard!"
1215,@511,"R-run! I can’t fight
right now!"
1216,@510,"I see you’re tired,
brat."
1217,@511,"I can’t believe this!
This is a nightmare!"
1218,@510,"All wizards of the
Ivory Tower will die!"
1219,@511,Argh!!!
1220,Void Demon,"Finally found you,
Ivory Tower brat.
Hehehe..."
1221,@1220,Die!
1222,@493,"What did you do to
my comrades?!"
1223,@1220,"Curiosity killed the
cat. Hehehe."
1224,@1220,"I’m sure they went
someplace nice.
Probably. Hehehe."
1225,@1220,You’ll join them soon.
1226,Swan,"Stop right there!
Ivory Tower twerp!"
1227,@1226,"You’ll interrupt us?
Hehe. Alright. I’ll
give you a present."
1228,@1226,"Behold! The fruits of
his amazing power!"
1229,@1226,"It’ll devour you!
Not even your bones
will be left!"
1230,@1226,"I’ll be going, so
you can have some
fun with my
pet ant. Hahaha!"
1232,Mutant Armored Ant,"Kreeek! Kyah!
(It seems to be very upset.)"
1233,@475,"Mhm! It’s clearly
very angry."
1234,@475,"You can deal with this
by yourself, right?"
1235,@475,"You! Such a huge
disappointment. I can’t
believe you’re in
cahoots with Staris!"
1236,@512,"Don’t make false
accusations, you witch!"
1237,@512,"He’s a member of the
Silverlight Mercenaries!"
1238,@512,"Pay the price
for your sins!"
1239,@475,"Fine! I’ll gladly do so
after I kill you!"
1240,@475,"But are you even
prepared to pay the
price for your sins?"
1241,@191,"Out of the way,
foreigner! Don’t butt in!"
1242,@512,"Whoa! Please, don’t
do this!"
1243,@191,"Interrupt, and I’ll kill
everyone! Well,
I was going to
kill you anyway!"
1244,@512,"Aw, come on!
Why does everyone
want a piece of me?!"
1245,Looter Captain,"You’re the yahoo
those red-headed
cowards sent!"
1246,@1245,"Come out, everyone!
Rob these guys
blind!"
1247,@1245,Oh! You’ve got some skills!
1248,@1245,"Hey! Quick!
Get everyone together!"
1249,@1226,"Run away! Struggle!
Hahahaha!"
1250,Staris's Minion,Mew! Very bad. Mew!
1251,@1226,"How did they find us?
There was definitely
no one tailing us."
1252,@160,"Dark Brotherhood!
Your ways are obvious!"
1253,@1226,"You damn eye-sore!
You’ll be sacrificed
to Scorpion, the
terror of the desert."
1331,@2318,"Catch and bring back
as many Ol Mahum
as possible."
1332,@2318,"In the meanwhile,
I’ll prepare the cage!"
1333,@2318,"Nice! Now we only
need to trap the
Ol Mahum and wait!"
1334,@2318,"Hmm, looks like this
cage won’t be enough."
1335,@2318,"The plan was a success.
The Ol Mahum
are coming!
Prepare for battle!"
1336,@2318,"That’s Quick Foot!
He’s incredibly fast!
We must catch him!"
1629,Quick Foot,"How dare you harass
my minions?!"
1630,@1629,"You guys really think
you can catch me?"
1337,@2442,"Oh no! The Ol Mahum are
coming to
raid us!"
1338,@2442,"Defeat
them."
1339,@2442,"I’ll prepare
the experiment!"
1340,@2442,"As expected,
the Stone Golem Core
is attracting
the Stone Golems!"
1341,@2442,"The core’s
Mana is incredible!"
1342,@2442,Whoaaaaaa!
1343,@2442,The Saharas are coming!
1344,@2442,"Please!
Stop them!"
1345,@2442,"It’s almost over!
Just a little more!!!"
1346,@2442,Shriek!!!
1347,@2442,"Be careful...
I can’t believe a monster
like this showed up!"
1672,@475,"Quiet, Staris!
Stop barking like a dog!"
1673,@1226,"Would you stop for a
sec? Be considerate
to the person who’s
been waiting! Rude!"
2129,@2368,"First off, please deal
with the surrounding
Watchers."
2130,@2368,"We can’t move
freely because of
the Watchers."
2131,@2368,"The monsters seem
to be coming
from over there!"
2132,@2368,Let’s hurry!
2133,@2368,"Monsters!!!
The monsters are coming!"
2134,@2368,"Where did these
things come from?"
2135,Fenril,"Argh!!!
Arrgh!"
2136,@2368,"Fenril?
What happened?!"
2137,@2135,"Argh!
Arghh!!!"
2138,@2368,"Fenril, it’s me!
It’s me, Arche!"
2139,@2135,"Argh!!!
Arrgh!"
2140,@2368,"The monsters seem
to be coming
from over there!"
2141,@2368,@2132
2142,@2368,"We need to
remove this
Magic Circle."
2143,@2387,"First, find me
the hearts of
Wastelands Basilisks!"
2144,@2387,"They’re famous for
surviving a long time
in the desert without food!"
2145,@2387,"This time, find me
the hearts of
Mutant Armored Ants!"
2146,@2387,"Lastly, find me a
Sahara's Heart!"
2147,@2387,"My research equipment!
Help me!"
2148,@2387,"The monsters
are aiming for me!"
2149,@2387,"Oh no! Scoundrels!
My research equipment!!!"
2150,@2387,"Show them
no mercy!!!"
2151,@2387,"Beat them to
smithereens!"
2152,@2387,What’s that?!
2153,@2387,"I’ve never seen
such a large Sahara!!!"
2154,@2387,"Whoa!!!
It’s coming this way!!!
Be careful!"
2155,@2313,"I can see several
Skeleton Sentinels."
2156,@2313,"Please be thorough
in dealing with them!"
2157,Fallen Scout,"Ugh...
Save me..."
2158,@2157,"Save me...
Skeletons... The Skeletons..."
2159,@2157,"Argh!!!
It’s all over!
Everything is done for!"
2160,Leonic,"Life...
Life belongs to me."
2161,@2160,"Kill them all...
All life belongs
to me!"
2162,@2313,"They say you can find
an exceptional number
of ants near an
Ant General’s nest."
2163,@2313,"Defeating as many as
possible now will make
things easier for us later."
2164,@2313,"Find the Ant General’s
nest! And be ready
to fight when you do!"
2165,@2313,"We found the right one!
Prepare for battle!"
2166,@2313,"Defeat all
of them and the
Ant General will appear."
2167,@2313,"It’s the Ant General!
Be on your guard -
if you’re bitten, there’s no escape!"
2170,@2313,"This is
another Ant Nest!"
2171,@2313,"Prepare to
fight the
ants!"
2172,Shane,"They say the Scripture
is to the south."
2173,@2172,"Defeat the monsters
blocking the way
to the Scripture."
2174,@2172,"Look! I see the
Scripture over there!
Hurry and take it!"
2175,@2172,"Oh no! Monsters!
Prepare for battle!"
2176,@2172,Sigh. Nothing’s easy!
2177,@2172,"Argh!!!
What’s that huge ant?"
2178,@2172,"Oh, Maphr!
Please protect
me!!!"
2179,@2172,"The Scripture should
be to the South."
2180,@2172,"There!
I see my Scripture!
Let’s go!"
2181,@2387,"Look!
There’s an egg!"
2182,@2387,"Be careful!
The mother will attack
us if she’s nearby!"
2183,@2387,"Oh no!
The Basilisks noticed us!"
2184,@2387,Be careful!!!
2185,@2387,"Holy-!
That’s a humongous
Basilisk!!!"
2186,@2387,@2154
2187,@2437,There’s a place I noticed earlier!
2188,@2437,"There!
Set the bait over there!"
2189,@2365,"A merchant!
Attack!"
2190,@2365,"Give me everything
you’ve got!!! Ahahaha!"
2191,@2437,Hehe. Look at this!
2192,@2437,"We’ll lure them once
more and deal with
the root of the issue!"
2193,@2365,"Goods!!! Attack!!!
This is a raid!"
2194,@2365,Let’s take it!!!
2195,Kashtray,"Ha! Imbeciles!
Can’t believe they fell for our trap!"
2196,@2195,"How dare you
make a fool of my minions?!"
2197,@2195,I’ll make you pay!
2198,@2318,"He should be
at the Inner Post."
2199,@2318,"Let’s defeat
the Ol Mahum
nearby!"
2200,@2318,"Wow.
Not bad!"
2201,@2318,"Let’s deal with
Traman quickly, too!"
2202,Traman,"Hehehe!
Foolish Human!
Back again?"
2203,@2318,"You don’t think it’ll
be as easy as last time, do you?"
2204,@2202,"Hey, Dorothy!
Go home and
let your mommy kiss
your boo-boos!"
2205,@2318,Arrrr.
2206,@2202,Kill!
2207,@2202,"I see you’ve
brought a match
for me this time!"
2208,@2202,"Will you be
able to beat me?"
3276,Nine,The cubs like fresh meat so come quickly when you find some meat!
3277,@3276,Oh! Please bring back something tough the cubs can chew on!
3278,@3276,The legs of Armored Ants would be perfect!
3281,@512,Your pet seems to take after you!
3282,@512,Defeat the nearby Saharas to get some fine sand!
3284,@512,We need wood to build a wall!
3285,@512,We can bring the ones we left behind when we were chased off by monsters.
3286,Sabero,What if we catch and sell this Black Bear at the Trading Post?
3287,Ribero,A wonderful tomorrow and bright future await us!
3290,@3287,Uh oh! We’ll take this matter into our own hands!
3291,@3287,NO!!! That’s MY Black Bear!
3490,@3276,Careful! The cubs are coming! Slow down little ones. Eat slowly.
3492,@3276,"Found one! This guy seems to have escaped on his own! Quite impressive, isn’t it?!"
3493,@3276,Thank goodness! I found another one!
3494,@3276,I see Team Bear! I’ll be hiding but please be sure to save the remaining Black Bear cubs!
3495,@3276,Nice! Let’s walk the cubs for a bit while we’re at it.
3496,@3276,The cubs can’t keep up if you go that quickly!
3497,@3276,This sure is strange. There seem to be more of them. Am I imagining it?
3498,@3276,Phew. We’ve returned to the campsite. I’ll take them to the enclosure.
526,@1323,"Find the girl!
Krrrk!"
527,Lieutenant Vacen,"Quiet!
Off with you,
damn Orcs!"
528,Young Soldier Mike,"There are still
more Orc
Escorts remaining."
529,@528,"Let’s go around
since there may
be more."
530,@528,"There! I see a
huge Orc!"
532,@528,"Why’s there a
picture of a girl
in this letter?"
533,@528,"Almost as though
she’s wanted..."
534,@528,"Look!
The bounty
is no joke!"
535,@528,"You can take the
letter, but in return..."
536,@528,"Can I take this
Orc Captain’s head?"
537,@528,"Everyone will
be proud
of me, right?"
538,Breka Orc Ranger,"Krkk! I’m positive!
That’s him!!!"
1254,Captain Karrack,"Oh, yeah? Hey, you!
Mr. Arrogant! Hand
over the captain’s head
and the picture!"
539,Marina,"Be careful!
They’re calling
for backup!"
1255,Hunter Kakish,"The prisoners are
escaping! Capture them!
Don’t let them escape!"
540,Lost Child,"Perhaps...
Has anyone seen
my younger sister?"
541,@540,"Please look for
my sister..."
542,@540,"We went for a stroll
together, but"
543,@540,"a bad wizard
tried to grab us."
544,@540,"When I managed
to get away, I
noticed that my
sister wasn’t
with me."
545,@540,"And... I was
captured by Lizardmen."
546,@540,"I hope she’s
alright... Elie..."
547,Guard Captain Thano,"There will still be
Lizardmen around. Be
careful looking
for her!"
548,@539,"Good luck, Leia!
I hope you find your
younger sister!"
551,Leto Lizardman,"Thieves! Shhk! Shhk!
Where did you hide it!
Shhk!"
552,Guard,"Who are you
calling a thief,
you looters?"
553,Sticky Entomo,"How dare you, a key,
not even a Human,
resist!"
554,@553,"Come along quietly!
It’s not like we
can kill you."
555,@553,Get the girl!
556,Mystic Zaab,"Destroy the Evil
Summoning Stone!"
557,@556,"Monsters will continue
to appear if you
don’t destroy
the Summoning Stone!"
558,Vascilious,"Hahaha!
Shall we start
playing for real?"
559,@558,"You
arrogant brat!
Die!"
561,@160,"Quite a cunning
trick you used!
Dark Brotherhood!!!"
562,@160,"You may be ahead,
but you won’t get
what you want!"
563,@160,"Since they went to
Cruma, it’s obvious
where they’re headed!"
564,Leia,"Shrieek!!!
Save me!!!"
565,Leia,"Go away!!! Go away!
Save me!"
566,Orc Captain,"Kill that Human!
Kill!"
567,@528,"Uh... Wah!!!
H-help!"
568,@528,"Wow! Your skills are
quite formidable!
Great! Have a taste,
you Orcs!"
569,Leia,"I’m alright! Let’s
go somewhere we
won’t be seen!"
570,Krush,"Shhhk!
Has your bravado
driven you mad?"
571,@570,"You will pay for the
deaths of my minions
with your life! Shhhk!"
572,@570,"I’ll massacre the
entire town! Shhhk!"
573,Varash,"Did you kill
my minions?"
574,@573,"Shhhk!
Do you want to
join this one?"
575,@573,"Actually!
I’ll let you live! Shhhk!"
1631,@573,"It just so happens
we need a target
for shooting practice! Shhhk!"
1256,@553,"Squaaaaaawk!
Pesky mercenaries!
Let’s see how you
handle this!"
1290,Lucas,"You should be able
to find some evidence!"
1291,@1290,"What if something
bad happens
because of this
ruckus we’re causing?"
1293,@1290,"I saw a
huge Lizardman
over there!"
1295,Leto Lizardman Sentry,What do you want? What are you bugging me for? Shhhk!
1296,@1295,"So you want me to kill you?
Terrific!
I was getting bored! Shhhk!"
1297,@1295,"Shhhk! Quick! We must
go! Thrush has
summoned us!"
1298,@1295,"This guy’ll be a piece of cake!
Shhhk! Let’s kill him before we go!"
1300,Thrush,"What in the world?!
What happened to you all?!
Shhhk!"
1301,Leto Lizardman Fighter,"Shhhk! We’ll
take care of it,
Thrush!"
1302,@1300,"Ahaha! You guys want to
show off your abilities? Shhhk!"
1303,@1301,Leave it to us! Shhhk!
1304,@1300,"You fools!
I can’t believe I trust you!
Shhhk!"
1305,@1300,"Hey!
Everyone! Get out here!
Fresh meat!"
1306,@1300,"Did you guys not hear me?!
Why won’t this
guy die?!"
1307,Evna,"Can you hear me?
I’ve cast a
simple incantation."
1308,@1307,"I’m trying to be
helpful by searching
for Krush."
1309,@1307,"I’ll let you know when I
catch wind of Krush."
1310,@1307,"An individual with
a strong life force
has caught my eye!"
1578,@1307,"It’s not far!
Go ahead!"
1579,@570,Hmm... not bad? Shhhk!
1580,@570,"Killing you slowly will
bring me much
amusement!"
1581,@570,"Hahaha! How about it?
You want to die, right?!"
1632,@1307,"Eliminate Varash’s
minions."
1633,@1307,"They’ve committed
heinous crimes!"
1634,Varash's Elite Soldier,"Aha! This is mine!
I found this one first!
Shhhk!"
1635,Tony,"Please don’t kill me!
I’ll give you all I have!"
1636,@1634,"First to kill gets the kill!
No dibs! Shhhk!"
1637,@1634,"Alright! Let’s make
a bet! I’ll put a hole
in its head! Shhhk!"
1638,@1635,S-save me!
1639,Screash,"I can’t believe you’ve
resorted to violence
after coming all the
way here! Shhhk!"
1640,@1307,"Your wickedness
ends here,
Screash."
1641,@1639,"Ugh! You’re so uptight!
I haven’t even killed
200 of them!"
1642,@1307,"Oh, my goodness!"
1643,@1307,Can’t forgive you! Screash!
1644,@1639,"Why? Didn’t you say
that Eva was merciful?
Shhhk?"
1645,@1307,"Even if the goddess Eva
forgives you!"
1646,@1307,"You’ll die by
my hands today!"
1647,@1639,"For a priest of Eva,
you sure talk like
Gran Kain! Shhhk!"
1648,@1307,Shut up!
1649,@1639,"Tired yet, priest of
Eva? Shhhk!"
1650,@1307,Not yet! Huff... Huff...
1651,@1639,"Shhhk! Hehehe.
Your escort looks
tired too!"
1652,@1639,"Well, come on then!
Shhhk! How funny!
Hahaha!"
1848,@160,"Wait! Someone’s
coming!"
1849,Morgoh,"Hehehe...
Just as Elizabeth
said, right?"
1850,@1849,"We found the child
thanks to you.
This is your cue
to leave."
1851,@160,"Did they notice us
following them?
Tsk, take care!"
1852,@1849,"Hand over the key -
and your lives!"
1853,Leia,Shriek!
1854,@160,"They’re not normal!
Be careful!"
1876,Pavel,Take a look around at our surroundings.
1877,@1876,There should be some specialized hunters!
1878,@1876,The academic world considers these guys a different species.
1879,@1876,But I have a different opinion.
1880,@1876,They must be the same species as the Enraged Wasps!
1881,@1876,You’ve got to find me a sample!
1882,@1876,The especially large one is a mutant.
1883,@1876,I want to find the reason for the mutation! I’ll leave it to you!
1884,Theron,Garok is the oldest among the Breka Orc Fighters.
1885,@1884,The Breka Orcs live and die on the battlefield.
1886,@1884,They rarely live to die of old age.
1887,@1884,"The older a Breka Orc Fighter is,"
1888,@1884,the stronger that fighter is.
1889,@1884,"Oh, I forgot something important. There is a Berserker among them."
1890,@1884,"He’s very strong, so you should be careful!"
1891,Garok,Yawn! This is terrific - I was getting bored!
1892,@1891,I haven’t been able to kill enough yet today!
1893,@1891,Hang in there! Make this enjoyable for me!
1894,Leto Lizardman Archer,I can’t believe you’re using violence here! Shhhk.
1895,@1894,All this laughing is making me feel weak. Shhhk.
1896,@570,Shhhk! Has your bravado driven you mad?
1897,@570,I’ll kill you as payment for killing my minions! Shhhk!
1898,@570,I’ll massacre the entire town! Shhhk!
1899,@1301,It’s time to practice archery! Shhhk!
1900,@1301,Shhhk! Where do you want to be hit? You damn no-scales!
1901,@573,Who sent you?! How dare you attack me?! Shhhk!
1902,@573,Shhhk! Fire! Fire your arrows!
1903,@573,I’ll turn you into shish kebabs! Shhhk!
1904,@1639,Who is this brat bothering me? Shhhk!
1905,@1639,Hehe. This will be a perfect test for my new curse! Shhhk!
1906,@1639,How ridiculous! You will die! Shhhk!
1907,@1639,"Everyone, attack! Shhhk!"
1908,@1639,Shhhk! I’ll make your bones dance like seaweed!
1909,Mechillen,The more aggressive one is a male.
1910,@1909,It may attack us in an effort to protect its group.
1911,@1909,"Usually, the males are no good for cooking."
1912,@1909,But the Alpha Male is different.
1913,@1909,Please capture the Alpha Male
1914,@1909,if you have a chance.
1915,@1909,You may irritate them if you focus too much on hunting.
1916,@1909,You’ll know it’s time to stop when the Vampire Bats start attacking.
1917,@1510,Yes! Don’t let even a single one escape!
1918,@538,"Krrrk! What do you want, nerd? Want to die?!"
1919,Breka Orc Ranger Captain,Be ashamed! You fools!
1920,@1919,Did you really lose to this wuss?!
1921,@1919,I’ll personally put their head on a pike!
579,Laris,"What a relief!
It’s a comrade!"
580,@160,"Elizabeth! What
are you thinking?!"
581,@255,"Theodore! I
don’t want you to
come here and die."
582,@255,"Killing you slowly
brings me such joy!
Hahaha!"
583,@160,"Damn it!
I’m sure the spy
already got to it!"
584,@104,"The only ones
who went this
way were Horace, Laris,
and Mitereu."
585,@104,"One of those three
must be a spy!"
586,@160,"Then... Leia is in
great danger!
Hasten the pace!"
587,@102,"Ahh! Be careful!
It’s a Skeleton Pursuer!"
588,Horace,"Hehehe. Do you see
this? I belong to the
Dark Brotherhood!"
589,@588,"Elizabeth!
Look forward to it!"
590,@588,"I’ll get rid
of these guys!
Hehehe!"
593,@160,"The strength of
the Giants lies
dormant within
Cruma Tower."
594,@160,"There are many
searching for the
secret to
that strength."
595,@160,"Even Hardin is
highly interested
in it."
596,@160,"I’ve called upon
a friend
to help you."
597,@160,"I’ve got to go
after Elizabeth!"
598,@195,"I’ll beat her to a
pulp when I see her!"
599,@195,"Running again?!
Stop right there!!!"
600,@255,"Hehe! Come
play at the tower
when you have time."
601,@255,"I hope you have
a good time"
602,@255,"getting the tower
key from my men.
Hahaha!"
603,@195,"Over there!
There are people
in front of the ruins!"
604,@337,Who is it?!
605,@195,"Hand over the key!
I’m busy!"
606,@337,Damn it... Stop them!!!
607,@195,"You just watch!
I’ll find the other
key, too!"
608,Leia,"Here, I feel my
abilities slowly
returning."
609,McCrane,"I can’t hand over
the key
to you fools!"
610,@195,"Fight well!
I’m speaking
with Leia."
611,@337,"Kill them all
except for the child!"
612,Leia,Give me back my little sister!
613,@337,"Hehe... Don’t worry.
She’s being treated
well."
614,@337,"You’ll have to
come along, too!"
615,@195,Step back! Leia!
616,Leia,"It’s a must if we
want to stop
the hallucinatory
effects of the
swamp poison!"
617,@195,"You’re not bad! Why
do you need
such a thing?"
618,Leia,"There! Over there!
Let’s follow them!"
619,Magikos,"Tsk... Have we
been discovered?
They’re so stubborn!"
620,@619,"Keep them
away from us!
Kill them all!"
621,@195,"What? Take me, too!
Theodore!"
622,@255,"Aren’t you
late, Theodore?"
623,@255,"This would disappoint
Hardin, wouldn’t it?"
624,@160,...
625,@160,"Don’t touch the
relic, Elizabeth!
Nothing good will
come out of it
for you!"
626,@255,"For Hardin?
Or for me?
If not us,
then maybe..."
627,@255,For you?
628,@255,"Hahaha. What will
you do?
It wasn’t Elie."
629,@255,"Poor Elie will need
an antidote for the
Swamp poison,
don’t you know? Hahaha!"
630,@255,"Oh, another failure.
What will you do?
The clock is ticking."
631,@160,"Stop it, Elizabeth!
I can’t stand to
watch this anymore!"
632,@255,"Hmph! It’s my choice,
Theodore! Who do
you think you are?"
633,@255,"Let’s put an end to
this game of tag."
634,@255,"This has gotten
boring since you
all can’t keep up."
635,@160,"They are subjects of
Cruma Tower!
Be careful!"
636,Marsh Stakato Slave,"Warning!
Intruder alert!"
637,@636,"We. Will.
Protect.
Our. Group."
638,Zyrnna,"Group is
under attack."

640,@638,Who are you?
641,@638,"I am Zyrnna,
the Marsh Queen!"
642,@638,"This is our land!
You are intruders!"
643,@638,"I won’t let
you live!"
644,@1312,"Collect plenty of
Dark Essence."
646,Arcane,"Damn it!
We can’t escape!"
647,@646,"Who summoned me?
I want to see
your ugly mug!"
648,@1312,"I’m not ugly!
At least,
not as ugly as you!"
649,@646,"How dare you
insult me?! I’ll
make sure your death
is extra-painful!"
650,@1312,"Won’t kill
swiftly..."
651,@1312,"That sort of thing...
That’s my specialty..."
652,@646,"Run! As fast as you can!
I’m angry!"
653,@1312,It’s impossible.
654,@646,"Wahh!
Leave me alone!!!"
655,Skeleton Pursuer,Uhhhh...
656,@655,"Calling
me..."
657,@1312,"This side effect
is on the weak side."
658,@655,"I...
Want...
You..."
659,@655,"Ah...
Hungry..."
660,@1312,"The desires of the
dead are
especially dangerous."
661,Liam,This curse is... almost like...
662,@661,"Sweet...
So sweet!!!"
663,@1312,"My curse
gives pleasure,
not pain."
664,@1312,"The dark entities
will be especially
difficult to resist."
665,@661,"I can’t stop!
You! I’ll swallow
you whole!"
666,@1312,"That seems physically
impossible..."
1289,Guard Ligus,"Huh? Is it Horace?
Why is he wearing
such dark clothes?"
1653,@1312,"Collect and return with
bone powder from
the Skeleton Pursuers."
1654,@1312,"Pummel them to
smithereens. Simple,
right?"
1655,@1312,It’s Ronde. Destroy it.
1656,Ronde,"Who goes there?!
Who summoned me?!"
1657,@1312,"Can’t you tell from
the situation?"
1658,@1656,"Right! I’ll rip out your
heart and squash it!"
1659,@1312,"I... like...
the sounds of that."
1660,@1656,"Arghh!
You arrogant brat!"
1661,@1312,"The summon gate
won’t shut.
This is tricky... Hmm..."
1662,Skeleton Scout,Ah... Target...
1663,@1662,"Kill...
..."
1664,@1312,"For skeletons,
they’re very articulate."
1665,@1662,"I...
will slaughter
you..."
1666,@1312,"That would’ve sounded cooler
if I said it to
an opponent
I could beat..."
1667,Ancelotti,"We’ve got to take out
some of these Marsh Stakato slaves."
1668,@1667,"They are the
lowest class within the
Zyrnna group."
1669,@1667,"They’re also the most
important foundation."
1670,@1667,"Step back when
the time is right!
They’ll counterattack soon!"
1671,@1290,"Gasp!
W-we’re alive! Ahh..."
1954,@1667,We’ve got to take out some of these Marsh Stakato slaves.
1955,@1667,They are the lowest class within the Zyrnna group.

1969,@1312,@653
1970,@646,Wahh! Leave me alone!!!
1971,@655,Ugh...
1972,@655,Calling me...
1973,@1312,This side effect is on the weak side.
1974,@655,I... Want... You...
1975,@655,Hungry...
1976,@1312,The desires of the dead are especially dangerous.

1981,@661,I can’t stop! You! I’ll swallow you whole!
1982,@1312,That seems physically impossible...

1995,@2309,I feel dark energy all the way from here!
1996,@2309,Are you alright?!
1997,@1994,To think you were in cahoots with that underling of Einhasad! I’ll punish you!
1998,@2289,Help me meow! I’m being attacked meow!
1999,@2289,I’ll hide carefully.
2000,@2289,These guys are really fur-rocious!
2001,@2289,Watch out fur the big one!
2002,@2289,This’ll go on fur-ever
2003,@2289,if we don’t take out the big one! Get him meow!

2007,@1290,Gasp! S-scary!!!
2008,@1290,I’ll look for it! Hang in there a little longer!
2009,@2387,"We need to deal with those guys over there, too!"
2010,@2387,Do I strike fear into your foolish hearts?
2011,@2387,I’ll make sure you scram and stay scrammed!
2012,@2294,"They’re still nearby! Look again, meow!"

I don’t want to
hunt icky spiders!"
1311,@677,"I was chasing a big,
juicy rabbit when all
of a sudden, a spider
appeared out of nowhere!"
678,@160,"Tanor and the
Ol Mahum have been
at odds for
generations."
679,@160,"Recently, a war
broke out
between them."
680,@160,"The Tanor were
close to victory,
but the war
dragged on"
681,@160,"because the Dark
Brotherhood joined
in support of the Ol Mahum."
682,@160,"The war will
create
dark energy,"
683,@160,"which Beleth will
surely claim for himself."
684,@160,"You can see why the
Dark Brotherhood
doesn’t want this
war to end."
685,@160,"We must put an end
to this war through
Tanor’s victory."
690,Tanor Knight Recruit,Over here!!!
691,@431,"Let me
meet the chief.
I don’t want
any trouble."
692,@690,"What’s a doomed fool
like you want
to meet the chief for?"
693,@431,"Haha, nice! This is
what makes
Tanor so great!"
694,@690,"Ptooey!
Damn you! Die!"
1857,@690,Release the beasts!
695,Durzel,"Tanor doesn’t see
much difference
between friends
and enemies."
696,@695,"That is, as long as
you’re not an
Ol Mahum."
697,@695,"Negotiations are
simple! You just
have to beat
these guys!"
698,Tanor Soldier,"Who’s there?!
We’ll burn you alive
when we catch you!"
699,@431,"How cool is this?
These guys
don’t even care
about putting out fires!"
700,@160,"If the chief refuses
Hardin’s offer..."
701,@160,"I don’t even want to
think about what
will happen to the
Tanor next..."
702,Tribal Chief Kankoon,"Did you think I
would agree to such
a rude request?!"
703,@702,"Kill
them all!"
704,@431,"Yes, I know.
Tanor!
Go ahead and resist."
705,@702,"Don’t look down
on Tanor!"
706,@431,"Of course not.
If I did, I would
have killed
you already."
707,@702,YOU!!!
708,Tanor Priest,"How dare you attack
our chief?!
Kiss your
lives goodbye!"
709,@695,"Hold on!
We’ve just here
to negotiate!"
710,@690,"We must kill anyone
and everyone who
attacks our chief!"
711,@695,"As expected!
Classic Tanor
negotiation tactics!"
712,@431,"Oh, brave Tanor.
We have a
common enemy!"
713,@431,"Are you aware the
Dark Brotherhood
has aided the
Ol Mahum?"
714,@702,"Hmm...
The Dark Brotherhood?"
715,@695,"Well, well.
We have much
to discuss."
716,@695,"What are all those
Tanor doing?
Have they come
to see us off?"
1351,Tribal Chief’s Group,"It’s them!
Kill! Kill them!"
1352,@695,"Oh no! The opposition!
Be careful!"
717,Warchief Kankoon,"The chief is wrong!
You don’t have any
right to negotiate."
718,@1351,"We’ll destroy you
by order of
chief Kankoon!"
719,@717,"We’ll rip you to
shreds, just like
the Ol Mahum!!!"
720,@717,"We always
kill our enemies!"
721,@717,"That is the way of
Tanor!"
722,@717,What are you scheming with the chief?!
723,@717,"Why did you steal
the Relic of Tanor?"
724,@695,"The chief agreed
to cooperate with us!
Sheesh!"
725,@717,"You’re our enemies!
Not friends!"
1858,@717,"A worthy opponent!
I’ll bring my weapon!"
726,@160,"Hardin always
wanted the
Relic of Tanor."
727,@160,"He said that one
needs to earn
the trust of the Tanor Chief"
728,@160,"to acquire that
power. Seems he
was successful."
729,@229,Who is it?!
730,@229,"How dare you
lay hands on the
subjects?"
731,@229,"You will pay for
foolish actions with
your lives!"
732,Borys,"Please...
I hope they’re alright..."
734,@732,"Hey!
It’s me, Borys!
Your friend!"
735,Necross,"Ha! Do you think
they’re going to
recognize you?"
736,@735,"Magic is not
such a weak thing."
737,@732,Hey! Dark Brotherhood!
738,@735,"Excellent! That
anger! The dark
energy!"
739,@735,"Let your hatred run
wild! Wonderful!
Hahaha!"
742,@160,"Find Durzel.
He comes and goes
as he pleases, but
I’m getting worried."
743,@695,"No! We’re a step late!
Be careful!"
1409,Chief Alarac,"I’m back! Die!
You Tanor-alikes!"
744,@695,"Quickly!
Destroy the Soulstone!"
745,@695,"The Ol Mahum will
come running!"
1422,Ol B’Khan,@604
1423,@1422,"Huh? Who’s that?
Are they in cahoots with Tanor?"
1424,Ol Mahum Vanguard,"We’ll take care of it, Ol B’Khan sir!"
1425,@1422,"What’s going on?! You can’t deal with
one pest?!"
1426,@1422,"We’ll be late to
hunting Tanor!
Stop messing around!"
1427,@1422,"Go!
I’ll kill you myself if
you can’t deal with this!"
1428,Ol Mahum Trooper,"Oh no! Kill them!
Ol B’Khan is angry!"
1429,@1428,Argh! Die!
1434,@1422,"Not too shabby.
Who sent you?"
1435,@1422,"How dare you
try to fight me."
1436,@1422,"Tanor or not,
it makes no difference!"
1437,@1422,"I’ll kill you and
drink ale from your skull!"
1438,Bartum,"Tartan over there
is looking away.
This is our chance!
Let’s move quickly."
1439,Tartan,"Who is it?!
Quit your yammering!
You’re good for nothing!"
1440,@1439,"Argh!
I can’t move!"
1441,Tartan’s Minion,Tartan?!
1693,@1439,"They’re using some kind of trickery!
Everyone, be careful!"
1694,@1441,Protect Tartan!
1695,@1438,"Hurry!
Defeat the minions!"
1696,@1439,"Oh no!
Don’t kill
my minions!"
1442,@1438,Argh!
1697,@1439,I’ll rip out your throat with my teeth!
1698,@1438,"T-to think he
broke the spell! Argh!"
1699,@1439,"You’re the criminal!
You damn fanatic!"
1700,@1439,"Damn it...
You!
Why..."
1443,@1438,"We got some very
useful information
from the Ol Mahum."
1444,Thaartan,"Hey!
Who left
this wagon here?"
1445,@1444,"Arghh! What!?
Who’s there?
What are you doing?!"
1446,Thaartan's Minion,"Thaartan,
what’s wrong?!"
1701,@1438,"No mercy
for intruders!"
1702,@1446,"Thaartan has
been attacked!"
1703,@1444,"Ah! This is embarrassing! Over here!
Release me and we can talk!"
1704,@1438,There’s no use in talking!
1705,@1444,"What are you saying?!
Hey! Hey!
Release me!"
1447,@1444,"You damn
bugs!
Faster!"
1706,Lieutenant Thartos,Thaartan!
1707,@1444,"I’ve been hit with magic!
I can’t move!"
1708,@1706,"You guys are despicable,
using a dirty trick like that!"
1709,@1706,"Rescue
Thaartan!
Everyone attack!"
1710,@1444,"You thug!
I’m innocent!
This is ridiculous!"
1448,@1438,"We need
to aim for when
Tutan is outside alone.
Let’s go."
1449,Tutan,"You’re suspicious!
What business
do you have here?"
1450,@1449,Augh! A restraining spell?!
1451,@1449,"We’re under attack!
Get the one
in the dark clothes!"
1711,@1438,"They’re planning to
break my concentration!
I’ll leave you with the defense."
1452,Thartos,"Tutan
was done in by a spell?!"
1712,@1452,"I’ll give you a taste, too!
How dare you do that to Tutan?!"
1713,@1438,"Oh, no!
A shaman’s curse
is difficult to deal with!"
2050,Ashley,Cull the Black Leopards
2051,@2050,and set up the decoy.
2052,@2050,We don’t want anything strange getting caught with the decoy.
2053,@2050,Did you set up the decoy? Has Sharon appeared?
2054,@2050,There’s is a female Black Leopard called Sharon.
2055,@2050,We need to catch Sharon!
2056,@2050,Has Sharon appeared?
2057,@2050,"You’ve got to catch her, okay?"
2058,@2050,They’ll gather all at once when you set up the decoy.
2059,@2050,"If you can deal with multiples at once, then give it a try."
2060,@2050,@2057
2061,@1438,This should be enough.
2062,@1438,Let’s go to catch Tartan!
2063,@1439,Who’s there? What’s all this ruckus?!
2064,@1438,You must defeat Tartan’s minions first if you want to catch him.
2065,@1439,Who sent you? I’ll deal with you myself!
2066,@1438,Well done! Defeat Tartan!
2067,@1438,We’ve located Thaartan.
2068,@1444,"Huh? Back again, Priest?"
2069,@1438,Thaartan! Come quietly!
2070,@1444,I’ve told you many times that you’ve got this all wrong!
2071,@1438,Tell that to Maphr when you see her!
2072,@1444,You are so beyond words!
2073,@1444,"Since discussion’s getting us nowhere, I’ll let my fists talk!"
2074,@1438,"Ha! Finally, you reveal your true nature!"
2075,@1444,I’m tired! Buzz off already.
2076,@1444,Idiot! It’s not me!
2077,@1438,Tutan’s surrounded by minions! We’ll deal with them first.
2078,@1449,Huh? What’s this spell?
2079,@1438,Tutan! You’re under arrest!
2080,@1449,You again! I’ll make sure you never harass Tanor again!
2081,@1449,Damn - a moron with conviction!
2082,@1909,Ah! The Red Truffle’s over there! We’ve got to grab it!
2083,@1909,Oh no! Are you alright? These Venomous Spiders are dangerous!
2084,@1909,Watch your back!
2085,@1909,Take a risk and get better ingredients!
2086,@1909,Let’s be a bit more greedy!
2087,@1667,We’ve found Ol B’Khan! Hurry!
2088,@1422,Huh? Who’s this guy? Is he in cahoots with Tanor?
2089,@1424,@1424
2090,@1422,Stupid vanguard!
2091,@1422,"Let’s go, Troopers! I’ll lead the way!"
2092,@1428,"Yes sir, Ol B’Khan! Raaaarrr!"
2093,@2318,Did you perhaps see Mitchell over there? I thought I saw something!
2094,@229,Who are you? What are you doing here?
2095,@2318,"Uh oh, we’ve been caught! It’s every man for himself!"
2096,Ol Mahum General,Where are the officers? They’re slacking off!
2097,@2096,Were you playing with this guy here?
2098,@2318,Whoa! What’s that guy doing here?!
2099,@2437,You’ve got to learn when to quit!
2100,@2437,What’s the point if you die?
2101,Ol Mahum Commander,Someone’s causing a disturbance!
2102,@2101,Stop them from escaping!
2103,Ol Mahum Commanding Officer,Hey! Hey! You dimwit! Do I have to step in?
2104,@2103,Surround them! Attack from behind!
2105,@2050,@2058
2106,@2050,@2058
2107,@1438,Look around the wagon!
2108,@1438,"No need for chit-chat. If anyone gets in your way, get rid of them!"
2109,@690,Who’s there? Scram!
2110,@1438,We found signs of Real Goods!
2111,Tanor Scout,What are all these boxes for? Who are you guys?!
2112,@1438,"This is where you stop, you criminals!"
2113,@2111,"What are you talking about? Get out of here, you lout!"
2114,@1438,Don’t hesitate! Attack!
2115,Tanor Shaman,Enemy spotted! We’re under attack!
2116,@1909,@2082

2118,@1909,@2084
2119,@1667,Ol B’Khan’s minions! Over there!
2120,@1424,"Well then! Let’s meet today’s quota, okay?"
2121,@1424,This one’s mine!
2122,@2318,@2093
2123,@229,@2094
2124,@2318,"Uh oh, we’ve been caught! It’s every man for himself!"

746,@160,"So many have died
unjust deaths
on this land."
747,@160,"There was one
who refused to fall
and struck a deal
with the Demon."
748,@160,"When he was human,
he was called
Guillotine..."
749,@160,"Once revived,
he became
worse than
any Demon."
750,@160,"As expected!
It’s the
Black Willow!
Be careful!"
751,Murmur,"Who dares disturb
my slumber?"
752,@160,"It’s normal for
Black Willow
to not be here!"
753,Mandragora,Shriek!!!
754,@186,"Argh! What’s that noise?!
My eardrums are
about to explode!"
755,@186,"Huh...? The sound is
attracting attention!"
756,@431,"Be careful!
The Undead
are coming!"
757,Vindictive Killer,"You too will
die in vain,
just as I did!"
758,@1597,"Oh, my!
It wasn’t just a
tree, but instead a
willow! Be careful!"
759,@1597,"They’re coming!
We must guard
the furnace!"
760,@337,"I’m surprised to
see you here,
Hardin."
761,Captain Mania,"...is it him?
The one who’s
bothering us?"
762,@431,"You seeds of
darkness sure do
funny things."
763,@431,"Do you really think
you can do anything
with skills like yours?"
764,@337,"Captain Mania, I’ll
leave you to deal
with this fogey.
Your lord beckons."
765,@761,"You cannot stop the
coming of the lord!"
766,@431,"What? Has he
become a god of
some kind? You’re
merely a minion of a Demon!"
767,@761,Shut up!!!
768,Nerkas Necromancer,"Watch where you
put your hand,
you inferior wretch!"
769,@1597,"Hush! This way!
Next to the stairs."
770,Guillotine of Death,"The seal
will soon be undone."
771,@770,"Bring me
their heads!"
772,@1597,"It’s dangerous!
Even for a
a powerful wizard
like you, Hardin!"
773,@1597,"He’s the one
who fought and sealed
the ancient heroes!"
774,@1597,"There! The Ruined Keep!
There’s a 
barrier!"
775,@431,Get ready! One!
776,@431,Two!
777,@431,Three!
778,@431,"Full speed ahead!
Retake the
keep!"
779,@1597,"The furnace is
damaged. Do you
think the furnace
will hold for
long enough?"
780,@431,"It should hold for a
moment! Run quickly!"
781,@186,"The energy of death
is enough to make
my hair stand up!"
782,@186,"Treasure or not,
it’s more important
for us to survive!"
783,@186,"Uh... The Undead
are coming!!!
S-stop them!"
784,@186,"Meow! Save me!
Wahhh!!!"
785,@186,"They’re coming
again! Wahh!"
786,@431,"The army of death
is here!!!"
787,@431,"Guillotine may not
be able to emerge,
but his army surely
will!!! We must
guard the furnace!"
788,@186,I-I’ll h-help too!
789,@770,"Your efforts will be
for naught!
Soldiers! Bring me
their heads!"
790,@770,"We’ll use them to
decorate the banners!
We will make
my return known!"
791,@1597,Be careful!!!
792,@1597,"Hardin...! W-we
can’t hold out
any longer...!"
793,@431,"If we fall, Giran is
doomed! Hang in
there! Hold on!"
1674,@431,"Just hold on for 10
more seconds! Hold
on like your life
depends on it!"
1675,@770,"Damn it!
What are you doing?!
Put the fire out!"
1855,Roy,"D-don’t touch it...
Give it here...
The Caravan Leader
will be upset..."
2209,Neville,Something’s surrounding me!
2210,@2209,My goodness! I thought it wouldn’t attack if I didn’t touch it!
2211,@2209,Who’s that? They look dangerous!
2212,Dread Specter,Arghh...
2213,@2209,Ah! Damn it! I shouldn’t have come here!
2214,@2209,This way! I have a bad feeling about this!
2215,@2209,Argh! Back again? I’m about to go crazy! Help me!
2216,@2209,"T-that one is a bit larger, isn’t it? It looks different from the other ones!"
2217,Twisted Doom Servant,Hehehehe...
2218,@2209,D-did you hear that? He’s laughing. Ugh... I don’t like it!
2219,Yumaeri,There should be many Dicor of Sorrow around the Flower of Sadness.
2220,@2219,Eliminate any Dicor that may be of danger.
2221,@2219,There! I see the Flower of Sadness!
2222,@2219,Protect me while I gather the flower.
2223,@2219,Whoa! Help me!!!
2224,@2219,D-defeat the Mandragora!
2225,@2219,I’ve never seen a Dicor that big! Are you sure you can beat it?!
2226,Carmen,Defeat the Dicor of Despair.
2227,@2226,Wait.
2228,@2226,Something’s odd.
2229,@2226,This Dicor has been corrupted by strange energy.
2230,@2226,I’ll look for its source.
2231,@2226,Found it! The energy is coming from that strange post.
2232,Dryed,"Well, well... A guest!"
2233,@2232,Welcome. Do you also want to be part of my garden?
2234,@2232,"Well, well! I can’t believe you destroyed my precious flowers!"
2235,@2232,I can’t bear to watch any more of this!
2236,@2232,I’ll deal with you myself!
2237,@1667,"According to the Wizard, a Reaper called Repus has consumed the most souls!"
2238,@1667,Repus! Find Repus!
2239,@1667,The spirits are coming! Be careful!
2240,Repus,What a tasty-looking soul!
2241,@2240,Die!!!
2242,@1290,Thank you so much for your help!
2243,@1290,There is an Innocent Spirit on the way to Kamel.
2244,@1290,Defeating them will be advantageous for you in battle.
2245,@1290,I-it’s Kamel.
2246,@1290,Look at that bloodstained blade!
2247,@1290,They seem awful to fight against.
2248,@1290,Woah!!! The spirits are coming!
2249,@1290,Kamel! It’s Kamel the Butcher!
2250,Toat,Roarrr! How dare you set foot in my sanctuary?
2251,@2250,I’ll rip you to shreds!
2252,@2250,You defeated the Necromancers - not too shabby!
2253,@2250,"Now, behold the power that Guillotine bestowed upon me!"
2254,@768,Souls! Fresh souls!
2255,Inore,Please don’t fall prey to them!
2256,Tortured Specter,Pain... Only pain keeps me alive...
2257,@2255,What other proof of existence is there...?
2258,@2255,They need to be put to rest.

2271,@2226,@2228
2272,@2226,This Dicor of Despair seems to be under something’s control.
2273,@2226,I’ll look for the controller.
2274,@2226,Found it! The magic device over there is controlling the Dicor.
2275,@2226,We need to destroy it.
2276,@2226,Oh no! The freed Dicor are coming for us!
2277,@2226,Be careful!
2278,Frantic Soldier,H-Help us!!!
2279,@2278,Arrghhh!
2280,@2278,Reaper!!! The Reapers are coming after us!
2281,@1290,Oh. Please make sure you have the Spirit’s chain!
2282,@1290,"After all, we should console the townsfolk!"
2283,@1290,Watch out! Spirits!
2284,@1290,S-save me!
2285,@1290,Uowaaaaaah!
2286,@1290,Wahh!
2287,@1290,I won’t die!
2288,Innocent Spirit,Shrieeeek!
3247,@431,It’s the undead who guard the incinerator!
3248,@431,No time to be hesitating!
3249,@431,Defeat them now!
3250,@770,Argh!!!
3251,@770,Hardin! Hardin!
3252,@770,How dare you! The Soulstone!!!
3253,@770,"Army of Undead, get rid of them!!!"
3254,@431,"They’re coming, careful! You must protect me!"
3255,Corps Leader Pugg,What are you doing at my incinerator!
3256,@3255,I’ll cut off your limbs and burn them!
3257,@3255,Guillotine will surely be happy!
3258,@431,It’s Pugg! Careful!
3259,@431,He’s the cruelest among the Army of Undead!
3260,@431,"However, he is a bit stupid!"
3261,@431,Prevent him from coming close!
3262,Apostle Erzael,Fools! I can’t believe they were killed by this lot!
3263,@3262,You cannot destroy Guillotine’s Soulstone!
3264,@3262,Demons! Heed my call!
3265,@431,An apostle?! Things sure are a mess!
3266,@431,There isn’t much left! Take care of your soul!
3267,@431,He’s a demon that eats souls!
3268,@431,Focus!
3269,@431,Hmm? What is this dark energy?!
3270,@431,Careful! We’ve got a tough one coming!!!
3271,@431,Nice! The Soulstone has been destroyed!!!
3272,@431,Now is the chance! Guillotine’s Soulstone is destroyed!
3273,@431,We need to defeat him completely!
3274,@431,Use the Summoning Stone to follow me!
794,@186,"See the
Flat Mushrooms here?"
795,@186,"They’re my secret!
Ordinary people don’t
know about them."
796,@186,"We’ve got to
pick and take
all of them!"
797,@186,"Keep this
a secret from other people!"
798,@186,"These ones are
really high-quality!"
2038,@186,"Hey... Does that girl
over there look like
Alice?"
2039,@186,"Purr... Could it really
be Alice?"
801,Alice,"I paid up
last time!
Leave me alone!
Bring back Vehin!"
802,@186,"What’s happening?!
You jerks!
Let Alice go!"
803,@186,"Take this money!
Bug off!"
804,Tax Officer,"H-huh? Oh no!
What are you doing?!
Why aren’t you dealing with this?!"
805,Giran Guard Captain,Hmm. How bothersome.
806,@801,"Vehin was
drafted and
taken away."
807,@186,"Sigh! How did
things turn out this way?!"
808,@801,"Well, if you’re heading
to town,"
809,@801,"I can
lead the way!"
810,@186,"Don’t worry too much,
Alice!
Money is my specialty!"
811,@186,"I’ll be back after
selling my goods.
It won’t take long!"
812,@801,"In the past, I saved
Vehin and Pan
from certain death."
813,@801,"Ever since,
Pan has been coming
to see us regularly."
814,@801,"When the three
of us hang out,
time really flies...
Hehe..."
815,@801,"Vehin would be happy
to know that
Pan came..."
816,@801,"I’ve asked the
Elder to help
with finding Vehin.
I need to see him."
819,Botanist,"This land
turned barren
because of Medusa."
820,@819,"We needed
a way to stop the
curse of petrification."
821,@819,"The experiment has
already succeeded.
We merely need the right materials."
822,@819,"If successful,
we will not only
be able to take preventative measures"
823,@819,"but also
reverse the
petrification."
824,@819,"Of course, we’ll
need Sandflower grass."
825,@801,Over there! It’s Vehin!!!
826,@801,"Vehin! Drink this!
It’s a potion 
to stop petrification."
827,Vehin,"Really?! We’re safe!
Thanks, Alice!!!"
828,@827,"So... make juice from it
and mix it with the potion?"
829,Vehin's Comrade,"Huh?
What happened to me?
Is the petrification over?"
1922,@186,"Ah! An alpha Red Bear!
We have to catch it meow!"
1923,@186,"It may be tough,
but we can’t give up!"
831,Medusa,"Sisters!
Stenoa will be here soon!"
832,@831,"We can’t let
the garden
defilers escape!"
834,@160,"Huh. I guess
there was something
more important
to Pan than money."
835,@160,"Just like us,
ordinary people."
836,@160,"Come to think of it, this is..."
837,@160,...my hometown.
838,@160,"The place I left
after I became
a Dark Elf..."
839,@160,"Who besides Beleth
could have
this sort
of energy...?"
840,Seal Sentry,"Intruder!
The price of arrogance
is death!"
841,@160,"It’s the Seal Sentry!
Be careful!"
3213,@160,"Why is the
Seal Sentry here?!"
842,@160,"I heard the
Blood Queen is
connected to
the creation of the Dark Elves."
843,@160,"I don’t know much
about
Dasparion..."
844,@160,"Just his
name."
845,@160,"The cloak from before
might belong to
Dasparion."
846,Blood Queen,"Hahaha...
I smell his scent
on you..."
847,@160,"Did Dasparion
seal you?"
848,@846,"You and my most
loathed Human
are deeply connected."
849,@846,"Did Dasparion
send you
to kill me?"
850,@846,"I guess he’s not
satisfied with simply
betraying me!"
851,@160,"I don’t know
what you’re talking about.
I don’t know Dasparion."
852,@846,"Hahaha.
You really don’t
know anything.
That sure is funny!"
853,@846,"Hmmm... I wonder
how long the secret
will last? Dasparion! Haha!"
854,@131,"Hahaha!
Finally, some prey!
I’ll swallow you whole! Haha!"
855,@131,"Hmm?! But...
This sensation...?
C-could it be?"
856,@131,"It’s him! It’s HIM!
Aha!"
857,@431,"Well, Theodore,
did she say anything unusual?"
858,@431,"Say... about
the wizard
who sealed her."
859,@431,The worst situation?
860,@431,"Hehe... Isn’t
that something the
Lizardmen should worry about?"
861,@195,"But...
where did that cheapskate
Theodore go?"
862,@195,"That punk! He
teleported
without me
that time in Cruma Tower!"
863,@195,"I could’ve
caught Elizabeth..."
864,Langk Lizardman,"Shhhk! Arrogant punk.
Do you want to die?!"
865,Langk Lizardman Shaman,"How dare you break the totem?!
When I catch you,
I’ll break you!"
866,@112,"I didn’t break the totem!
Jeez!"
867,Langk Lizardman Recruit,"I-intruder?
I’ll show you the
results of my training! Shhhk!"
868,@112,"Oh no! The Lizardmen have
caught our scent!"
869,@112,"Conserve your
energy! You still have
to face the chief!"
2758,Langk Lizardman Warchief,"You punks! I’ll
skin you alive!"
870,@112,Aymel? Where is it?
871,@195,"I don’t know! You think I’ve
just been laying around?"
872,@195,"Look there!
Are those people
being held captive?"
873,@195,"Hey! You
smelly uglies!
Do you ever wash your scales?!"
874,@864,"Shhhk!
Grab that girl!
I won’t let you escape!
Shhhk!"
875,@195,"Hahaha.
You really think you can catch me?"
876,@864,"After her! Shhhk!
Catch
her! Shhhk!"
877,@112,"Ah... That girl...
She’s definitely the
best taunter
in the Silverlight Mercenaries..."
1924,@186,"Do you see that?
It’s the Cougar Leader!"
1925,@186,"That’s definitely
premium leather!"
1926,@186,"Don’t let it get away!
Get it for me meow!"
879,@195,"There! Over there!
Do something about it!"
880,@112,"Huh?!
Where’s my bow?!"
1513,Ominous Willow,Hot! Hot! This ignorant fool!
1514,@1513,I’ll squash you with my roots!
1515,Shrieking Treant,Fire! Fire! This guy is crazy!
1516,@1513,Shriek!!! Who is it?!
1517,@1513,I’ll teach you what happens when you play with fire!
1518,@1515,Are you in league with the soldiers chasing me?
1519,@1515,How dare you threaten me with fire?
1520,@1515,I’ll hang your head on the end of my pike!
1521,@768,Hehehe. A soul! I smell the scent of tasty soul!
1522,Balthazar,I smell souls! Whoa!
1523,@1522,Where is it? Where are these souls coming from?
1524,@1522,All mine! Mine! Hahahaha!
1525,@1522,Your soul is especially large and beautiful!
1526,@1522,Give me your soul! I’ll take it for myself! Hahaha!
1527,@2255,"The specters have gathered.
They smell
the living."
1677,@2255,"They’ll attack
to take over bodies."
1678,Cowboy,"Huh?
What are you guys
doing here?"
1679,Relentless Specter,"A living body!
Hehehe!
It’s so warm!"
1680,@1679,"Hehehe!
This body’s mine!"
1681,@1678,"Haha! This is such fun!
Shall we see who claims it?"
1528,@1678,"I’m bored!
You!
Let’s play!"
1529,@1678,"Well then!
Put up a fight!
This is fun, haha!"
1530,@2255,"Oh, no! This is tricky!
Try harder!"
1531,@1678,"Haha! This is fun!
Hehehe! Not funny!"
1682,@2255,"The Undead
are insane,"
1683,@2255,"but this one’s
especially nuts!"
1684,@1678,"I’m tired!
Sick and tired
of waiting!"
1685,@1678,"Now! Let’s fight!
Come on! Wahhh!"
1532,@1679,"Raaaaar!
Priest of Einhasad!"
1688,@1679,They’ve come to kill us!
1689,@1679,"We must kill
them first!"
1690,@2255,"Oh, no!
They don’t
like me!"
1533,@2255,"The Seamstress will
be summoned soon."
1534,@2255,"It’s a success!
Let’s deal with her quickly!"
1535,Seamstress,"Eh? What’s this?
A servant of
Einhasad!"
1691,@1535,"What? Defeat me?
Why won’t you die,
you slave?"
1692,@2255,"Die, you
blasphemer!"
1676,@2255,"Take a look around.
I feel a presence of
a strong specter."
1686,@1678,"Sorry, Elie...
I’m tired..."
1687,@2255,"My preparations
are close to completion.
Not yet?"
1927,East Gate Guard Balu,"I think there’s some
money in it for me
if I capture you and
turn you in. Hehehe!"
1928,East Gate Guard,"Balu! Don’t forget
about what I did!"
1929,@1927,"I’ll pay for everything today!
Hehehe!"
1930,Botanist,"There was even a Medusa
who was attached to
a statue it made..."
1931,@1930,Always be aware of your surroundings.
1932,Medusa Himena,"How dare you touch my work?
You rude punks!"
1933,@1932,"I’ll make sure you suffer!
I’ll turn you to stone,
then break you!"
1934,@831,"Stenoa will be angry!
Kazim, kill already!"
1935,Deluded Kazim,"No! Kazim obey!
Kazim kill!"
1936,@1935,Raaawr! Kazim kill you!
1937,@846,"Dasparion, is that you?
You’re despicable!
I’ll take you with me!"
1938,@431,"A pointless struggle.
Continuing the summoning now
would mean"
1939,@431,"You’ll be trapped
600 more years...
Hahaha."
1940,@846,"You’re vile! You
make Demons look good!"
1941,@431,"That Demon doesn’t
warrant any attention.
Deal with it quickly!"
2043,@1927,"Alice! Where are you
going?"
2044,@1927,"The Tax Officer
was incredibly
angry."
2045,@801,"Ah... That miser...
What shall we do?
It’s one of the Tax
Officer’s henchmen."
2046,Giran Guard,Hey! What’s this ruckus?
2047,@801,"M-more guards!
We need to
get away!"
2048,@2046,"Who’s there?!
Who killed you?
A spy from Oren?!"
2049,@801,"H-hurry!
The Gorgon Flower Garden
is this way!"
3241,@247,"Shhhk! Kill them!
Don’t let them interrupt
the ritual!"
3242,Innadril Ambassador,"I-is it the Silverlight Mercenaries?
Here! Over here!"
3243,@112,"Nice! Now!
Push all the way to the stake!"
3244,@195,"That tongue is
crazy-long! Russel!
Just run!"
3245,@247,"Giran is ours!
Shhhk! You think we’ll
lose the relic?!"
2497,@195,"Sorry, Russel!
The one with the really
long tongue was here!"
2498,@112,"Chancellor!
Just a minute!"
2499,@112,Here we go!
881,@186,"Arzen, what research material
could you paw-sibly need
to retrieve out of
all this ruckus?"
882,Arzen,"Us archaeologists
were studying
the history of Lesser Giants
in Cruma."
883,@882,"Our research showed that
the Lesser Giants
went into hiding
at the shore here."
884,@882,"But since our
research wasn’t finished,
we dispatched an
advance party."
885,@882,"We intended to wrap up
the research about
reviving the Lesser Giants
and then reconnecting with them..."
886,@882,"Hey!
Try taking me, too!
Or will you kill me
like you did Anna?!"
887,@186,"Ahh...
Calm down, Arzen!
Do you plan on killing us as well?!"
888,Ol Mahum Bandits Warrior,"S-stop it!
Sniff sniff...
We took them to
the boss."
889,@255,"Kya!
I’ll see you again...
If you manage to survive!"
890,Ol Mahum Bandits Commander,"Where are you going?!
You think I’ll let
you Humans escape?"
891,Anna,"It’s the remaining baddies!
We need to guard the Teleportation Stone!"
892,Hugh,"Isaac and I will
guard the Teleportation Stone!"
893,@882,"The fire will
soon die out.
Let’s go quickly!"
894,@186,"Meow...
If only I had a
Teleportation Stone..."
895,Ol Mahum Bandits Sentry,"Ruff! Ruff!
Hold it there, you guys!"
896,@882,"O-oh, no!
Run!"
897,Dismal Shout,"Do you think
you’ll be safe?
Feel my anger!"
898,@195,"Oh, my!
You can take
your rest, uncle!"
899,@255,"Hahaha!
Well, Theodore,
I’ll let you to it."
900,@160,"I’m worried Elizabeth
will use Gnosis
as part of
a scheme."
901,@104,"Gnosis
is a Lesser Giant scholar
at the Cruma Tower,"
902,@104,"so he has
extensive knowledge.
If that knowledge falls into the wrong hands,
we’re in trouble!"
903,@104,"If there’s an
awakened Lesser Giant
here, we may
be too late!"
904,@160,"Let’s hurry!
We need to stop her!"
905,Phobos,"Useless giant!
Prepare to die!"
906,@104,"We must stop her!
She’s planning
to kill Gnosis!"
907,@160,"Darn it! Kill him!
We must save the Lesser Giant!"
908,Death Flyer,"Did you think I’d
allow you to have
a nice rest?"
909,Ashear,"Be careful!
The Undead are coming!"
910,Aiden,"We have to stop
them from escaping
the Harbor!"
911,Zombie Pirate Navigator,"Step aside
if you value your life!"
912,@195,"We need to get out of here quick!
Everyone pay attention
and follow me!"
913,@909,"The Dark Brotherhood
attacked us
a while back."
914,@909,"We doubled security
after that."
915,@909,"But this time was different.
One of the attackers made
a contract with a Demon."
916,@909,"The Demon’s power...
It really put us down!"
917,@909,"We need to move quickly.
Everyone might have
already been defeated."
918,@160,"It seems meant to
take out anyone who
gets close!
Don’t let your guard down!"
919,Lesser Giant's Creation,Raaawr!!!
920,@160,"Oh, my. They just
keep on coming!"
921,@160,"Protect Feldheim
and the stone tablet!"
2933,Vargal,"You fools!
Bring that, too!"
2934,@2933,"Yea, that one!
No, not that one!!!"
2935,@2933,Does this look expensive to you? Bring back something useful! It’s so hard to find good help these days...
2936,@2933,Huh?!
2937,@2933,Sniff sniff. Who are you guys?
2938,@2933,Is this your wagon?
2939,@2933,"This is great, I wasn’t
getting anywhere, anyway.
Sniff sniff."
2940,@2933,I’ll steal everything - even your skivvies!
3082,Ruben,"First, defeat the
nearby Undead."
3083,@3082,"Leaving them alone
will make things
harder later."
3084,@3082,"Search the
northeast Harbor carefully!"
3085,@3082,"First, we’ll
need to defeat
his minions."
3086,Wandering Dead,Shriek!
3087,One-Eyed Alfonso,"I can sense your
moist eyeball."
3088,@3087,"Can’t you give
it to me?"
3089,@3087,"Make your choice.
Will you hand over your eyeball?"
3090,@3087,"Otherwise,
I’ll just kill you!"
3091,@3086,"Hehehe. Look, Captain!
They’re super scared."
3092,@3086,"What a bunch of cowards!
Hahahaha."
3093,@3087,"Quiet, you fool!
I’m talking!"
3094,@3086,"But Captain,
I was merely..."
3095,@3087,"Shut up!
This is why you guys
turn into zombies!"
3096,@3087,"Ugh! This isn’t fun anymore!
Die, you!"
3097,@3082,"I’ll leave you to focus on the
monsters to the northeast!"
3098,Shipwrecked Zombie Pirate,@3086
3099,@3098,"Nice to see you!
The boss will be happy!"
3100,@3098,"Give me
your head!
Ahaha!"
3101,@3082,"Defeat any
Undead you see!"
3102,@3082,"Leaving them alone
will make things harder later."
3103,Cry of Despair,"Arrgh!
The living!
I hate the living!"
3104,@3103,"I refuse to suffer alone!
You must die, too!"
3105,Holst,"Ouch! Ouch!
It hurts!"
3106,@3105,"This is your fault!
You deserve to suffer, too!
You deserve to suffer, too!"
3107,@3105,"Your death will be slow...
Hehe...
I’ll make sure you suffer..."
3108,@3105,"I’ll make sure you suffer!
You will suffer!"
3109,@3082,"I’ll leave you to focus on the
monsters to the northwest!"
3110,@2387,"Nice!
Now let’s use
the spell stone
to break the seal!"
3111,Creation of the Lesser Giant,"No!
Stop right there!"
3112,@2387,"Huh?
Oh, it can still talk!"
3113,@3111,"I won’t allow you
to come any closer!"
3114,Anggras,"Grrr...
Kill..."
3115,@2387,"The Lesser Giant
seems unusual, doesn’t it?"
3116,@3114,Will kill!
3117,@2387,"Hey, Lesser Giant!
Don’t take
your anger out
on me!"
3118,@2374,"Don’t forget to
collect the core."
3119,Degenerated Lesser Giant,Raaaaaaaa...
3120,@2374,"He’s still
a strong guy, even
if he’s regressed!"
3121,@3119,"You...
attacked us...
We will also attack."
3122,Gnall,"Stop these
barbaric actions!"
3123,@2374,"Oh! Someone
who can talk properly
has appeared!"
3124,@3122,"Do you think I endured
life in exile,"
3125,@3122,"only to be hunted
by you fools?"
3126,@3122,"You rude, arrogant
bunch of louts!"
3127,@2374,"Haha! The has-been is upset.
Don’t worry about it.
I just need to get the money!"
3128,@3082,"Now the
Undead don’t
scare me anymore!"
3129,@3082,"I’m not
sure what the
Demon is doing here, but"
3130,@3082,"I hope
this isn’t
the beginning..."
3131,@3082,"We need to find
and defeat the leader!"
3132,@908,"Some poor soul
is lost."
3133,@908,"Hahaha.
Well, we should
eat some grub"
3134,@908,before Aktomus comes!
3135,Aktomus,"Sigh!
What is this about?"
3136,@3135,"Are you losing to
a mere adventurer?"
3137,@908,"I... don’t have anything to say.
He’s really strong..."
3138,@3135,"Always give it your all!
Everyone, attack!"
3139,George,"I also handed over
the sacred incense burner."
3140,@3139,"According to the priests,
the dead will crowd together"
3141,@3139,"when you
light the incense."
3142,@3139,"Then, you can deal with
them all at once."
3143,@3139,"Well, I...
I wouldn’t even
try that, but..."
3144,@3139,"I think you stand
a chance.
Don’t let your guard down."
3145,@3139,"Do you really
intend on using the incense?"
3146,@3086,Argh!!!
3147,@3139,"Be careful!
They’ll rush in all at once!"
3148,@3086,"I feel hatred
filling my empty heart!"
3149,@3086,I’ll destroy that incense!
3150,@3139,"The incense is
burning even stronger!"
3151,@3086,"This incense!
It’s terrible!
Argh!"
3152,@3139,"It’s most likely...
Einhasad’s
incense."
3153,@3139,"The Undead abhor
Einhasad."
3154,@3139,"They even
fear her."
3155,@3086,"Get rid of that
this instant! Now!"
3156,@2442,"I’ve already been a part of
the Aden Explorers for three years..."
3157,@2442,"I often think about
why I’m doing
this sort of thing."
3158,@2442,"If it wasn’t for Dorothy,
I would’ve given this up a long time ago..."
3159,@2442,"Ugh...
That
fool
Mitchell!"
3160,@2442,"It’s a miracle
that we’re
still alive!"
3161,@2442,"Mitchell seems to
have really good
luck for some reason."
3162,@2442,Especially for someone so untalented!
3163,@2442,"Oh! I need
a few claws in addition
to the teeth!"
3164,@2442,"Fresh meat will
definitely attract
them!"
3165,@2442,"Whoa! Feeding frenzy!
They’re all
crowding
around!"
3166,@2442,"I’m not particularly worried.
Defeat them quickly and come."
3167,@2318,"They’re located
a short distance
from here."
3168,@2318,"Come back safely.
Hehe."
3169,@2318,"Don’t forget
to catch
their leader!"
3170,Bandits Pillager,"Huh?
What do you want?
Why are you looking for our boss?"
3171,@3170,"Sniff sniff!
Come play with me,
child. Hehehe!"
3172,Nagash,"Huh?
What’s up with that kid?"
3173,@3172,"Did that kid
really rob you?"
3174,@3170,"Yes! You fools!
Boss!
What should we do?"
3175,@3172,"You fool!
We plunder!
Rob them all!"
3176,@3170,"Got it, boss!
Sniff sniff!"
3177,@2318,"Don’t focus too much.
Leave at the right time."
3178,@3170,"Over there!
We looked for you for a long time!"
3179,@3170,"We can’t just let you leave!
Here we go!"
3180,@2437,"Have you ever heard
Dorothy and
Sara Ra
nagging simultaneously?"
3181,@2437,"They’d even wear
through dragon scales,
to give you an idea..."
3182,@2437,"Ugh.
I can already
hear them, and
it’s making me sick!"
3183,@2437,"Isn’t that my bag
over there?"
3184,Bandits Supplier,"What’s going on?!
Get ‘em!"
3185,@3184,"They’re the one
who’s been going around
picking fights!"
3186,Greedy Gudd,"Hey!
Their equipment
looks nice!"
3187,@3186,"It’s nicer than Grade A!
Jackpot!
Hahahaha!"
3188,@3184,"Captain!
They’re pretty strong!"
3189,@3186,"It’s all about equipment, isn’t it?
Can’t you tell by looking?
Take everything!"
3190,@3184,"Captain!
How can we win against
better equipment?!"
3191,@3186,"Quiet!
Do as you’re told!"
3192,@2437,"W-we need to find provisions!
If Dorothy finds out...
Ugh!"
3193,@2437,"Hurry up!
Quickly now!"
3194,@2437,"If you come up short,
then steal from
Ol Mahum!"
3195,Bandits Commander,"This is mine!
You thief!"
3196,@3195,"Only a fool steals
from bandits!"
3197,@3195,"You must
be insane!"
3198,Nabas,"You can’t even deal
with one person,
and you call yourselves officers?"
3199,@3198,"Men,
assemble!"
3200,@3198,"Die!
No-good pickpocket!
Don’t you know this
is my territory?"
3231,Bandit Leader's Left Hand,"Here are the rats!
Fools!
Get over here quickly!"
3232,@186,"Meow!
It’s Lyle’s left-hand man!"
3234,@3231,"Lyle nor his right hand
man is here so
I’m the boss!
Bring me their heads!"
3235,@882,"Just a little further
and we’ll reach the town!
We need to make it there!"
3236,@255,"Hey, Theodore, here’s a gift."
3237,@255,I hope you have a good time with Gnosis since you’re such a fan.
3238,@255,"Well, I’ll see you next time!"
3239,@160,N-no! Elizabeth!!!
922,Frederick,"It’s a trap!
There are Primas
pouring out!"
923,@552,"D-don’t touch it...
I-it’s mine..."
924,@195,"W-what’s the deal
with these guys?!
What’s wrong with them?"
925,@195,"Do you know
anything about
Zaken?"
926,@195,"Zaken is a pirate king
who was infamous
throughout Aden."
927,@195,"But one
day he
mysteriously
vanished."
928,@195,"A while later,
Undead pirates
started appearing
in Giran Harbor."
929,@195,"They proclaimed themselves
the Zaken Pirates.
See what I’m getting at?"
930,@195,@929
931,@922,"B-Barrett!
What do you
think you’re doing?!"
933,Barrett,"D-die!
No one can
have it! It’s mine!"
932,@160,"Oh no, are we too late?
Be careful!
They’re dangerous!"
934,Zaken Pirates Cutthroat,"Hehehe!
More stupid souls
got caught in
my trap!"
935,@160,"Oh, no! They’ve come
for our souls!"
936,@922,"Huh? What do you
mean there’s another one?
YOU!!!"
937,@922,"Y-you monster!
What are you doing
to my minions?!"
938,Soul Collector,"Your minions?
Thanks for providing
such worthy sacrifices.
Hehehehe..."
939,@938,"They will make a
suitable meal for our captain.
I suggest you say goodbye..."
940,@922,"N-no!
Wait!"
941,@160,"Frederick, wait!"
3223,@938,I’ll take your souls as well!
3224,@938,He’ll be happy.
3225,@938,This is my area!
3226,@938,You’ll never escape!
942,@160,"This shipwreck...
Is this Zaken’s pirate ship?
Hmm... Something’s odd."
943,@160,Why is Zaken’s pirate ship scuttled?
944,@160,Hmm... Seems you were right about the contents of the diary.
945,@160,Whoa! Ambush!
946,Killer,"It’ll be my pleasure
to take your souls!"
947,@922,"Was this you?!
Did you do this?!"
948,@922,"This is for the soldiers!
No one leaves
here alive!"
949,@922,Arghh!!!
950,@195,Over here! Here!
951,Nix,"Hand over
that crystal!"
952,@160,"We’re here!
Attack!"
953,@922,"Are you the one who
wrecked our advance party?"
954,@909,"N-no!
Leave us alone,
you Demons!"
955,@922,"Grab a hold of yourself,
Ashear!
It’s me, Frederick!"
956,@160,"It’s a lost cause!
We have no choice
but to defeat him!"
957,Osto,"Go, Caliban!
Trample those fresh souls!"
958,@957,"We can’t let Caliban
have all the fun."
3214,@957,"Time for me
to join in!"
959,@922,"Come at me,
you zombies!
You’ll never get
my body or soul!"
960,@195,"Captain Frederick!
Don’t overexert yourself!
You might reopen
your wounds!"
961,@922,"Hold it there,
you witch!!!"
962,@160,"Frederick, wait!
It has to be a trap!"
963,@195,"The pirates are coming!
Be careful!"
964,@922,"This is vengeance
for killing my minions!!!
Die!"
965,@195,"It’s us!
Get a hold of yourself, Frederick!"
966,@160,"It’s a lost cause!
We need to defeat him!"
967,Zaken,"Ah... Yes...
It’s you.
The ones who killed the collector"
968,@967,"and messed
with my crew...
What tempting
souls you have."
969,@967,"Brave souls like
yourselves deserve
special treatment."
970,@967,"I’ll make sure you’re
still alive to feel it
when I take your souls."
971,@967,"You’ve been busy
if you found
the relic!"
972,@967,"You’ll die in agony
long before you
seal my power!"
973,@160,"We must weaken
him first if we are to
seal his phantom!"
974,@195,"Leave the fighting to us
and focus on sealing him!
Theodore!"
975,@195,"There! On the bridge!
The pirates
are coming!"
976,@195,"Darn it!
Brace yourselves!"
1353,Sara,Be careful! Zaken’s crew is after the treasure!
1354,Zaken's Minion,Hehehe. All the treasure here belongs to Zaken.
1355,@1354,How dare you touch Zaken’s treasure!
1356,@1354,You’ll pay with your death!
1357,@1353,Phew! That was a close one! Good work!
1358,@1353,Next up is over there.
1359,@1353,I found a Blue Treasure Chest during my adventure!
1360,@1353,The Blue Treasure Chest should be in the gold pile to the north.
1361,@1353,Careful! This box is probably booby-trapped.
1362,@1353,"Oh, no! It’s a gigantic Scorpion!"
1363,@1353,Watch out for the poison!
1364,@1353,Nice! There’s only one left!
1365,@1353,The dark box should be to the east!
1366,@1353,Argh! Be careful!!! The monsters are coming!
1367,@1353,"Oh no... It’s Nassa!
Were we too greedy?"
1368,@1353,We can’t run from that guy!
1369,@1353,We have to fight for our lives!
1370,@427,W-who are you?! Have you come to rescue us?
1371,@427,There - pirates!
1372,@427,@2277
1373,@1354,Ahahahaha!!!
1374,@1354,There’s no escape.
1375,@1354,"Soon, Zaken will return!"
1376,@1354,He’ll come for your souls!
1377,Commander,Watch out for the Navigators!
1378,@1377,Hurry up and defeat him!
1379,@1377,The box should be inside.
1380,@1377,Hurry!
1381,Pirate Crew,Don’t open that box!
1382,@1381,You can’t take the skeleton!
1383,@2387,Defeat the Cutthroat!
1384,@2387,Find the shrunken monster!
1385,@2387,Whoa! Save me! Side effects? Nonsense!
1386,@2387,"I-I thought it was supposed to have side effects, but nothing this extreme!"
1387,@2387,The relic’s power is incredible. Defeat them!
1388,@2294,"If I recall correctly, Shamong's Grave is..."
1389,@2294,It should be by the bridge to the Gold Cave!
1390,@2294,The trip to the grave won’t be easy.
1391,@2294,Defeat the Premo on the way!
1392,@2294,"If you don’t defeat the Premo, I won’t get paid!"
1393,@2294,That’s enough!
1394,@2294,The necklace should be in the grave! Take it quickly!
1395,Succubus,"Oh, myyyyyy... Are you touching our treasure without permission?"
1396,@1395,Many people have come looking for it.
1397,@1395,Are you after it as well?
1398,@1395,Hahaha. What’s that face for? Let’s dance!
1399,@1395,"Any more temptation and you might end up buried, too, you know?"
1949,@922,"It doesn’t seem to be
here. Go over there."
1950,@922,The Prima are blocking our view.
1951,@922,These pests have been bugging me - get rid of them!
2040,Navigator Railey,"You guys sure are
noisy! And that thing
up front is the
noisiest of all!"
2041,@195,"W-What?!
Is that conch shell
talking to me?"
2042,@2040,"C-conch shell? I’ll
make you regret
your insolence!
Attack!"
3215,@195,"I’ll leave that side to you!
Time to clean some seafood!"
3216,@2040,I’ve cut limbs off plenty of your ilk!
3217,@2040,You will face the same fate!
2465,@195,"Damn it! I was trying to make things less dangerous, and instead, I made things worse!"
2466,@195,This conch shell sure is irritating!
3246,@195,I’ll destroy the whole lot of you! Bring it on!
2467,@195,"You should be fine on your own, right?
There must be something more here! I’m sure of it!"
2468,@195,Why are you complaining when you’re doing well? Hold on a little longer - this is important!
2469,@195,"Yes! I found it!
Are you still not done?"
3218,Rena,What are you cute babies doing in a place like this?
3219,@3218,I’ll charm you!
3220,@195,"I’m a girl, you know?"
2470,@195,"W-what? Uh...
I didn’t do something wrong, right?"
2471,Noel,"D-don’t... touch...
It’s... mine..."
2472,@195,"Wahh...
They... They’re coming again!"
3221,@195,They look like the Giran advance party. What’s going on?
3222,@195,Y-you’re not giving me much choice!
2473,@933,"G-go back...
I-it’s... mine...
K-kill..."
2474,@195,"Barrett, get a hold of yourself!
Okay?"
2475,@933,"S-stay back! Don’t touch me!
I-I’ll kill everyone!"
2476,Kirion,"This stench
is unbearable!
Who is it?!"
2477,@160,"What an incredible guy!
Watch out for his axe!"
2478,@2476,"A Human on Devil's Isle!
It’s been a while since I’ve felt the urge to kill!"
3227,@2476,@451
3228,@2476,I’ll rend you limb from limb!
2479,@160,"Ugh...
Incredible power..."
2480,@160,"Hmm? A book?
Bring it to me quickly."
2481,@160,"Be careful!
Ambush!"
3229,@160,You lot! Where did you come from?
2482,@195,"Are you crazy?!
Why do I have to hand it over?"
2483,@951,"Haha. You get excited so quickly!
If you won’t hand over the crystal, I’ll take it by force."
2485,@195,"Darn it... Did you
mind control the advance party?"
2486,@951,"Hahaha!
I’ll take my time to enjoy this!"
2487,@195,Ugh... You wicked...!
2488,@951,"Oh! Soldiers aren’t everything.
Hahahaha!"
2489,@195,"E-even the adventurers?!
You! I can’t forgive you!"
2490,@951,"You’re tougher than I expected!
I’ll deal with you myself!"
2491,@951,Arghh!!!
2492,@195,"Captain Frederick!
Theodore!
What took you so long?!"
2493,@160,"Focus, Aymel!
He’s not an easy opponent!"
2494,Executor,"Yes... Okay.
I command you in the name of darkness!
Awaken, demon!!!"
2495,Awakened Ancient Demon,Arghhh!
2496,@160,Ugh...! How dare you use Ashear as a sacrifice to call forth that Demon?! You vile filth!
3230,@160,"Everyone be careful!
He’s not an easy opponent!"
2572,@2294,Deal with Zaken’s Slaves right meow!
2573,@2294,"If they’re allowed to run wild, the sailors will be in danger! Hiss!"

2583,@2577,"Nero found it, meow?"
2584,Kenbell,How dare you go after my treasure?
2585,@2584,You must be out of your mind!
2586,@2577,This treasure is mine! I licked it!
2587,@2577,"I can’t just abandon such a valuable treasure, hiss!"

2598,Lemon,You dare try to take what is mine? You must have a death wish!
2599,@2598,Foolish Premos! You can’t guard one object?!
2600,@2598,You will pay for your greed with your life!
2601,@2294,Nesca disappeared over by all the Demons!
2602,@2294,"Defeat the Succubi and Primas, meow!"
2603,@2294,Purr-haps they’re hiding a clue!
2604,@2294,It’s Nesca! Mrow!
2605,@2294,"Thank goodness, meow! We have found Nesca!"
2607,@2294,"Woah! There come the Cat Merchants, meow!!!"
2608,@2294,They are the Cat Merchants who accompanied Nesca!
2609,@2294,"They all seem insane, meow! Can no one recognize me?!"
2610,Nesca,"Hehehehe. All the treasures here are mine, ruff!"
2611,@2610,Don’t you dare touch them! Ruff! They are all mine!
2612,@2610,Try to take what is mine and die!!! Ruff!
2613,@2387,Get rid of Zaken’s minions!
2614,@2387,"If you chase them, you’ll find their stash of gold!"
2615,@2387,There! Find the red gold in the pile of treasure!
2616,@2387,Watch out for Zaken’s minions’ attacks!
2617,@2387,"If you’re critically injured while holding the gold, kiss your soul goodbye!"
2618,@2387,"Oh, no. They’re coming! Be careful!!!"
2619,Karell,Looks like we’re adding another soul to the pile!
2620,@2619,@2300
2621,@2387,"First, defeat Zaken’s minions."
2622,@2387,They’ve always targeted us!
2623,@2387,Argh! Damn skeletons!
2624,@2387,Found it! Over there! Pull the relic out of the pile of gold!
2625,@2387,Be careful! It’s valuable stuff!
2626,@1354,Mana! I feel the relic’s mana!
2627,@1354,Zaken! Zaken wants it!
2628,Vic,Unhand the relic!
2629,@2628,You will pay for your actions!
2630,@1353,The way will be dangerous.
2631,@1353,Defeat any Lookouts and Cutthroats you encounter on the way.
2632,Cous,Here! Over here!
2633,@2632,Did Sara send you?
2634,@2632,There’s no time! Protect me from the monsters!
2635,@2632,Augh! Zaken’s minions!
2636,@2632,H-help!!!
2637,@2632,Hehe. Well done.
2638,@2632,"At last, the treasure is all ours!"
2639,@2632,"Now, prepare to die."
2640,@2632,"Men, kill him!"
2641,Ditch,It’s good practice to defeat any enemies you meet along the way.
2642,@2641,They aren’t picky about when they attack.
2643,@2641,"Seems you’ve dealt with most of the situation. Now, bring me the object!"
2644,Caruso,How dare you try to touch his stuff?!
2645,@2644,Your death will be unavoidable!
2646,@2644,I’ll deal with this myself! Consider it an honor!
2647,@2644,@2300
2648,Tark,"First, defeat the Boatswain and Helmsman ahead of you!"
2649,@2648,Avenge the soldiers they killed!
2650,Advance Party Soldier,"Die, you all!!!

977,@160,"How odd.
It’s about time Oren’s Peace Envoy arrived."
978,@160,"Oh, my. Is this Orc territory?
I need to meet up with the Peace Envoy quickly."
979,@160,"This is proof of the battle between the Humans and Orcs.
Could it be..."
980,@160,"We’ll go inside, but keep an eye out for Orc Sentries.
Follow me."
981,@160,Look carefully. There might be clues.
982,@160,"There’s a cage over there.
There may
be survivors!!!
Quick! Go check!"
983,Jen,Augh! Orcs! The Orcs are back!
984,@160,"Well, this has gotten complicated.
We must defeat the Orcs while protecting the Peace Envoy."
985,@983,"The Dark Elf
Wizard seems
to have gone somewhere."
986,@983,"I’m a diplomat,
not a soldier.
Don’t expect much
from me."
987,@983,"Ha! Those Orcs!
They got what they deserved!
Have a taste of that!"
988,Cara,"I couldn’t tell
from far away."
989,@988,"But up close,
you’re really cute!
Hehe."
990,@988,Your fur is so fluffy!
991,@186,"No! Paws off!
Every touch is
10 million Adena!
Mrow!!!"
992,@988,"It’s a success!
The Primas are
congregating nearby!"
993,@988,"There’s so many of them.
Maybe their
leader will appear!"
3201,@988,"How could this be?
It’s Gore!"
3202,@988,How many souls did it consume?!
3203,Soul Collector Gore,Did you really think I’d fall for a trick like that?
3204,@3203,Your souls look even sweeter!
3205,@3203,Hurry! Hand them over!!!
3206,@3203,You souls will live forever inside me!!!
3207,@3203,Quick! Come here!
994,@988,How about you guys stay here since it’s dangerous?
995,Arthur,Mrow! Are you telling us to stay by ourselves... in the middle of the Orc town?!
996,@995,"You guys are our only hope meow.
Please don’t throw our lives away!"
997,@988,All the Orc Warchiefs are gathered together.
998,@988,An Orc group of that size is truly daunting.
2769,@983,"Hold on!
You barbarians!"
2770,@988,"Jen, wait!"
2771,Breka High Warchief,"Hahaha!
I thought you guys
would flock like fireflies
once the ambassador was endangered!"
999,@983,"Ugh!
M-my leg!"
1000,@2771,"Hahaha!
What’s this?
You can’t even
stand straight!!!"
1001,@160,"Oh! We’re late!
We need to join them!"
1002,@2771,"What’s with this guy?
Pulverize ‘em!"
1003,@2771,"The signal fire’s lit!
You’ll make a
great sacrifice!"
1004,@160,"Wait, Cara!
Damn it, there’s no time!"
1005,@160,"Activate the Teleportation Stone!
Cara won’t be able to
hold out for long!"
1006,Celin,"Cara, how could you bring outsiders here?
Don’t you have any pride as an Elf?"
1007,@988,"Stop! They are our guests, Celin."
1008,Rowen,Cara should have told you about the Protection Tree.
1009,@1008,"In the past, this land was home to a verdant forest."
1010,@1008,"Then, one day, Dragons appeared and set the entire forest on fire."
1011,@1008,Only the Protection Tree and its immediate surroundings survived.
1012,@1008,We succeeded in driving off the Dragons.
1013,@1008,"There were some who rejoiced in the victory, but the town was uninhabitable."
1014,@1008,"Our homeland was dead, and the Protection Tree, the source of its power,"
1015,@1008,slowly faded.
1016,@1008,"At that moment,
the tree was beset
by villains."
1017,@1008,"And an Undead wizard, called
the Blood King, stole
its the essence."
1018,@1008,"We sent out pursuers,
but no one
came back alive."
1019,@186,Refund 10% of your lost pro-purr-ty? What do you mean by that?
1020,@186,"I’m going meow.
See you next time!"
1021,@104,I found a strange stone tablet while excavating.
1022,@104,"Ever since then, it’s felt as though the monsters have been attacking less frequently."
1023,@104,There seems to be something special about this stone tablet!
1024,@104,"Oh! I found something
intriguing recently.
Do you know about
the Blood King?"
1025,@988,"The Blood King...
The enemy of tree...!"
1026,@104,"I heard he was
an incredible Undead wizard
back in the day."
2949,@104,"I heard he grew too greedy
in his quest for Mana
and lost his life."
1027,@186,Don’t add too much salt to the fried egg.
1028,Dragon Knight Quesnel,"Are you still alive?
You sure are stubborn."
1029,@1028,"I’m sure you’ll die at the hands of Cager
and Veremus, even if you pass through here."
1030,@1028,"I will not allow
you to travel any
further into the valley."
1031,@1028,"I’ll end your
lives here!"
1032,Veremus,I was wondering who was digging around... seems I’ve caught a few flies.
1033,@1032,You’re fearless - but you’ll pay for barging into my nest.
1034,@1032,"The Blood King?
As if you have enough clout to question me."
1035,@186,I’ll take care of Cara and take her to the Elder.
1036,Blood King,"Ah... So there were
still descendants of the
Protection Tree?"
1037,@1036,"Truly incredible...
But I’ll have you know that I absorbed your essences."
1038,@1036,"Fighting you wouldn’t
be any fun,
would it?"
1039,@1036,"But... Oh! I know!
I’ll make you fight each other!!!"
1040,@1036,"Fight, descendants of the
Protection Tree!"
1041,Fallen Celin,Ugh!!! Ahhh!
1042,@1041,My head!!! My head!!!
1043,@1041,"The Blood King
is trying to
control me!"
1044,@1041,"If I lose control of myself,
don’t hesitate!
Kill me!"
1045,@1041,"I don’t want
to be a burden!"
1046,@1036,"Not bad!
But this too
shall end soon!"
1047,@186,Mrow! I’m so glad to see the Elves alive again! (Sniff sniff.)
1048,@186,I’m not crying! Where did all these onions come from?
1400,@2442,Argghh!!! Help!
1401,@337,Hahaha... How dare you try to find the spellbook!
1402,@337,Tsk. A heckler. Get rid of him!
1403,Borgos,Who do you think you are? Kill them all!
1404,@2442,There’s the spellbook! Grab whatever and run!
1405,@2442,They’re coming after us! Hurry up!
1406,Nithos,Arrghhh! Help!!!
1407,@1406,The monsters are aiming for me!
1408,@1406,Isn’t this my sword?! Thank you!
2772,@2771,"Make mincemeat
of them!"
2773,@2771,"Hey, Ambassador!
Prepare to watch
your rescuers die!"
2774,Caranese,"Ugh... Be careful!
Jen! You mustn’t die!"
2775,@1006,Who’s there?
2776,@1028,"I knew I smelled
some putrid pointy ears
around here..."
2777,@988,"Dragon Knight Quesnel...!
Ugh..."
2778,@104,"Step back!
Niah!"
2779,@1028,"That stone tablet...
Hehehe. You’ve been
hard at work."
2780,@1028,"Bring the stone tablets with you.
Capture the Elf alive
and kill the rest."
2781,@102,"Eeek...!
You can’t take the stone tablet!"
2782,@988,"Feldheim!
Protect Niah!"
2783,@104,"Niah!
This isn’t what’s
important! Be careful!"
2784,@186,"Mrowwwww!!!
It’s the Grandis!!!
Help!!!"
2950,Mahmmon the Boss’s Brother,"How dare you kill my little brother?!
I’ll kill you!
Mahmmon will kill you!"
2925,@988,"Darn it!
They’re onto us!
Be careful!"
2926,@186,"Mrow? Destroy it?
That’s such a waste.
A little cat burglary couldn’t hurt, right?"
2927,@988,"Mr. Cat!
You’ll get sick
if you eat those!"
2928,Hammon,"Oh, no!
Cager’s minions
are following us!"
2929,@2928,Prepare for battle!
2930,@988,"Be careful!
It’s Cager!"
2952,Dragon Knight Cager,"Arrggghh!
What are you doing
to my Wyrms?!"
2953,@186,"Hiss! It’s Cager!
Hand over the
expensive Elven sword meow!"
2954,@2928,"Pan!
This isn’t the time to be playing around!"
2955,@2952,"If you want it that badly,
I’ll hand it over!"
2956,@988,"Huh?!
Surprisingly enough, that worked!"
2957,@2952,"That is, I’ll hand it over
right into your throats!"
2958,@2928,Watch out!
2931,@186,"That Elven sword
looks expensive!"
2932,@988,"What...
Don’t even think about it!"
2941,Chef Kachoi,"Ah! So the ruckus
in the kitchen was
all because of a rat."
2942,@2941,"Looks like
meat’s back
on the menu,
boys!"
2943,@2941,Hahahahaha!!!
2944,@160,"It’s done!
We’ll stand watch,
so you can untie
the Cardinal!"
2945,@988,"There should still
be Primas around."
2946,@988,"Ugh... They’re so persistent!
Get out of my hometown!"
2947,@988,"Do you remember
where we buried
that Sahara's Heart
earlier?"
2948,@988,"You just need to
head that way.
I’ll go ahead and meet you there."
3208,Grandis Leader,This is our land!
3209,@3208,Get off our land!!!
3210,@3208,"Die, outsider!!!"
3211,@3208,I’ll grind your bones to dust!
3212,@988,Be careful of his weapon!
3499,John,Come out guys!
3500,John’s Bandits,"Hehehe.
He’ll surely fetch
a price!"
3501,@3499,"Take everything
they have!"
3502,Female Windsus,Squeal!!!
3503,@3502,"Oink!
Squeal!"
3504,Male Windsus,Oink! Oink!
3505,@3504,Oink! Oink! Oink!
3506,@186,"Meow!
Grendel is coming!
Protect us!"
3507,@186,"What is that monstrosity?
I didn’t know a
Grendel could get so big!"
3508,@186,"Coocoo!
Dig faster meow!!!"
3509,@186,T-truffle!!!
3510,@186,"Argh!
Save me meow!!!"
3511,@186,"Coocoo!
Protect Coocoo!
Grendel is after
Coocoo!"
3512,Poricule,Get him!!!
3513,@3512,"Paralyze with poison
and bind him with spider webs!"
3514,@3512,"Intruder!
Catch him too!!!"
3515,@3512,"Tsk!
If only there wasn’t a heckler!
I’ll get you next time!"
3516,Pedicule,"You dare touch
my eggs?!
I’ll make you regret
trespassing in my web!"
3517,@3516,"Poricule will deal
with you, even
if I’m no longer around!"
3518,@3512,"Where are you
kids going?"
3519,@3512,"You will
nourish
my spawn!"
3520,@3512,"My spawn will grow strong off your bodies.
Your deaths will be peaceful."
3521,@186,"Argh!!!
The Atroxes
are coming at us!!!"
3522,@186,"Meow!!!
W-we need to get out!"
3523,Ravine Hunter,Argh!
3524,@3523,"Run!!!
We’re no match for them!"
3525,@3523,"Run!!!
We need to run away!!!"
3526,Town Chief Ariana,"Stop them!!!
We need to guard the assembly hall!
There are women
and children there!"
3527,@3526,"I’ll leave you to deal with
the fire in the south barracks!"
3528,@3526,"To the west!
The fire is spreading quickly!"
3529,@3526,"The fire has spread
to the storehouse!
Hurry!!!"
3530,@3526,"We must stop them from
entering the Campsite!"
3531,@3526,"We must stop
them at the bridge!"
3660,@186,"I-I’m scared!
Help me out!"
3532,Underboss Hadok,"You dumb pigs!
The queen said to
bring back the skeleton!"
3533,@3532,"Now! Bring back the skeleton!
Dispose of that
weak human!"
3534,Troop Captain Maxim,"You fools dare to
raid my lair?
I’ll destroy you!!!"
3535,@3534,"I’ll destroy
you all!!!"
3536,@695,"Come out quickly
or you’ll be surrounded!"
3537,@695,"Maxim is notorious
for sadism."
3538,@195,"You seem to be having a hard time!
Good thing I’m here to help!"
3539,@3534,"No human
poses a threat to me!
Die!!!"
3540,@195,"Phew.
That was tougher than I expected!"
3541,@195,"This place is dangerous.
Let’s get out
of here."
3542,Bugbear Devourer,"Sniff, sniff.
Meat...?
I smell meat!"
3543,A Hungry Bugbear,"You traitor!
Are you hoarding that all for yourself?"
3544,@3542,"I want some!
I want to eat, too!!!
Share that meat with me!"
3545,@3543,"There are humans here!
Let’s eat them, too!"
3546,Queen Piladesia,"How dare you
filth trespass here?"
3547,@3546,"Men!
Get rid of them!"
3548,@3546,"I’ll water the flowers
with your blood!"
3549,Emoleta,"Bug off, you slug!!!
The skeleton of the ancient
demon Musica is mine!"
3550,@3549,"I’ll drag you
all to hell with me!"
3551,Steiner,"I set off to find
the Lord of Oren’s missing wife
who disappeared around here."
3552,@3551,"Unfortunately, the swarm of Bugbears
is making my
search difficult."
3553,@3551,"She went missing
after her husband’s
concubine arrived."
3554,@112,"These Steel Bars
won’t break from such stones."
3555,@112,"It seems someone was digging
here but gave up half-way."
3556,Chief Guard Shakman,"Well, well.
How daring of you to attempt
a jailbreak under my watch."
3557,@3556,"You must be out of your mind!
You’ll all hang for this!"
3558,Kate,"Hurry!
This way!"
3559,Christine,@729
3560,@3559,"Well, well!
The Silverlight Mercenaries
are a bunch of small fries!"
3561,@3559,"Varto, Tory,
give them a beating!"
3562,@195,"Russel!
We wouldn’t have
struggled underground if you
hadn’t gotten us lost!"
3563,@112,"Haha! My mistake!
What matters is that
we’re all here now, right?"
3564,@112,"Let’s get some
Orenese armor first!"
3565,Raihel,"You guys
abducted Salein!"
3566,@3565,"Go to hell!
That’s the only
place you belong!"
3567,@3565,"I’ll make sure to finish
you guys off myself!"
3568,@3551,"Raihel,
stop!"
3569,@3565,"Steiner, you traitor!
I trusted you!"
3570,@3551,"Stop!
This is all a misunderstanding!"
3571,@3565,"I have no time for
a traitor’s lies."
3572,@3551,"They are innocent!
Please spare their lives!"
3663,@3558,"Let’s go to
the weapon shop!"
3664,@3551,"Okay!
Hurry over here!"
3573,@3551,"I want to deal
with them now but
we must find out
what they are headed."
3574,@3551,"The first lady
might be in great danger
if we aren’t careful."
3575,@3551,"Did nothing
happen in the cage?"
3576,@3551,"Russel said you
encountered some Lizardmen?"
3668,@3551,"I wonder if
Leto Lizardmen from
west of the town
are involved..."
3577,Creezaro,"You’ll make a
worthy sacrifice!
Kill them!"
3578,@3551,"Careful!
The Lizardmen are coming!"
3579,@3551,"I finally found you!
I’ve been looking all over the place!"
3580,Aisa,"Seems you had some trouble
despite how confident you were. Hehe."
3582,Crogurk,"Kill!
Grunky will surely be pleased!"
3583,@3551,Dumb lizards!
3584,@3551,"Showing your face here
is proof of your stupidity!"
3585,@3580,"Well, let’s get started!"
3586,@3551,"Aisa, I’ll leave it to you!"
3671,@3551,"Careful!
The Lizardmen
are coming!"
3672,Grunky,"What are you trying
to do to the Crystal?!!
Arghh!!!"
3589,@3551,"You lizards!
What the heck are
you up to?"
3592,@3672,"Kekeke.
You Humans are
so foolish..."
3593,@3551,What’s so funny?
3596,@3672,"Don’t you understand
that you’ve played
right into our
hands?"
3597,Crokyle,"My babies!!!
How dare you kill them!"
3598,@3597,"You there!
Send out the call!
Burn all the Humans!
Sacrifice them all!"
3599,@3597,"My children!
I will avenge you!"
3600,@3551,"Leave the
people alone!"
3601,@3597,"I’ll make sure you
share this pain!"
3602,@3597,"Just the thought of your
suffering gives me joy!
Hahahahaha!"
3603,@3551,"Salein!!!
Salein is over there!
I’ll trust you to deal with the shamans!"
3604,@3580,"Hurry!
The shamans have
begun their ritual!
We must hurry for Salein’s sake!"
3605,@3580,"N-NO!!!
It ate Salein..."
3606,High Shaman Shras,"Their blood will
enhance our intelligence."
3607,@3551,"We must not give up!
Salein was swallowed whole,
so she might still be alive!"
3608,@3606,"You lot honestly
think you stand a chance
against me? Die!!!"
3609,@3559,"You’ve ruined everything,
you wretched
Silverlight Mercenary!"
3610,@3559,"I’ll make sure to
kill you slowly!"
3611,Foreman Bakum,"Aha! You’re in
cahoots with Caraku!"
3612,@3611,"Kazan, the new chief,
will be unbeatable no matter
what you do!"
3613,@3611,This will be your grave!
3614,Chief Guard Croatica,"Intruder!
Find the intruder!"
3615,@3614,"How foolish.
They would still be alive
if they’d stayed still!"
3616,@3614,"Kill
them all!"
3617,@3614,"Not too shabby!
But now - you will know
Kazan’s strength!"
3848,@112,We’re here!
3849,Rakum,"Croatica!
Die, you traitor!"
3618,Chief Kazan,"I saved you because
you were the chief. And this
is how you repay me?"
3619,@3618,"You will pay for your
mistake with your life."
3620,@3618,"You guys are
nothing as long as
I have this."
3621,@3618,"You should’ve been thankful
that I made you humans!
Kill them all!"
3624,Enhanced Kazan,"This is so much more
fun than I expected!!!
But playtime stops now.
Time for you to die!"
3625,@112,"H-he’s...
He’s huge!"
3626,@160,"Do you recall the
agreement with the Tanor Chief
on the Summit of Dissonance?"
3627,@160,"We formed an alliance
with the Tanor in order to
help their unification efforts."
3628,@160,"However, the Tanor here
are cousins of
Kankoon, the Tribal Chief."
3629,@160,"The local chief heard
about Kankoon and has taken Durzel,
who was here as a diplomat, hostage.
He is currently making threats."
3630,@160,"There’s no time.
Let’s hurry!"
3631,Tribal Chief Hamgalalte,"Durzel?
You mean... that Human?
Why would I tell you anything?"
3632,@112,"We’re not
here to fight!"
3633,@3631,"I’ve heard countless tales
of your wicked ways!"
3634,@3631,"Did you think
I didn’t know
you stole the relic?"
3635,@112,"What are you talking about?
We asked you about Durzel."
3636,@3631,There will be no negotiation!
3637,@112,"Calm down.
Sheesh. They sure are
difficult to talk to..."
3638,@112,You leave me with no choice.
3639,@195,"Hey, look!
It’s the Dark Brotherhood!"
3640,@337,"Silverlight Mercenaries?
Are you here
looking for her, too?"
3641,@195,"Her?
Who are you talking about?"
3642,@337,"Anyway, this is fantastic.
Elizabeth will definitely be pleased!"
3643,@337,"When we capture you,
Elizabeth will see
how loyal we are!"
3644,@195,"You goons
dare stand in our way?"
3645,@337,"Bah!
We’ll finish this
next time!!!"
3650,@695,"Over here!
Help!!!"
3651,Molly,"Hurry!
We need to get out of here!"
3652,@3651,"I can feel my
pursuers’ presence!"
3653,@160,"We’ll hold them off!
Everyone else,
take care of the kid!"
3654,@695,"Okay!
Leave it to us!"
3655,@160,"Go!
Take the kid
somewhere safe!"
3656,Embrion,Bug off!
3657,@695,"Leave this to us!
RUN!"
3658,@112,"Ugh!
You’re going nowhere!"
3659,@195,"Darn it!
Hurry, this way!"
3661,Detained Hunter,"The Bugbears are coming!
We can’t leave the cage
until they’re gone!"
3662,Cuking,"They’re trying to escape!
There goes our dinner!"
3665,@195,"What happened to Steiner?
I thought he was captured alongside you."
3666,@112,"He managed to escape,
but I’m sure he was greatly
troubled by his country’s betrayal."
3667,@3558,"Steiner...
Do you mean the
Oren Royal Guard Captain?
How could someone like that..."
3669,@3551,"Darn it!
They’re on to us!
Be careful!"
3670,@3551,"It seems safe now!
Free the captives.
Hurry!"
3843,Oren Lord David,"Argh!
What is that?!"
3844,@3559,"The Northwind Plateau
belongs to us!"
3845,@3559,"He promised it
to you!"
3846,@3551,"Ah, that’s right.
I have something
to tell you."
4756,@186,Durzel! You ungrateful wretch!
4757,@695,What did you say?
4758,@186,Am I wrong? I brought the adventurer along!
4759,@186,"If I hadn’t, you could’ve died here!"
4760,@186,I saved your life!
4761,@186,You owe me one!
4762,@695,Hah. I see what you’re saying.
4763,@186,Repay my favor! I want repayment!
4764,@695,"Fine! Fine! Let me recover, then I’ll get you some Grendel Leather."
4765,@186,Grendel Leather? Is that all?!
4766,@186,I didn’t know your life was so cheap!
4767,@695,Arghh!!!
4768,@695,"Alright! Fine! I’ll get you some Adena, too!"
4769,@186,That’s better! I can live with that!
4770,@186,"(What a cheapskate, meow!)"
4771,@695,"(Just you watch, Pan. I’ll get you next time!)"
1050,,Huh? W-what is this!
1051,,Get out of my sight!
1052,,H-hey... wait...
1053,,"You're cursed dead!
Go away!"
1054,,Look! It’s a Teleportation Stone!
1055,,It's enormous!
1056,,My goodness! They were all here!
1057,,"Are you perhaps Eleanor’s younger sibling, Elos?"
1058,,"Ah, are you deaf?"
1059,,"Hey, say something!"
1060,,W-what is it?! What’s up with you?!
1061,,Stop them!
1062,,C-captain!
1063,,Theodore!
1064,,Step back. You guys don’t stand a chance.
1065,,Thunder Storm!
1066,,We’re saved!
1067,,Humph! How bothersome.
1068,,Elizabeth! This will be your undoing!
1069,,"Heh, heh... I wonder why Aymel is always in such a rush?"
1070,,Too cute!
1071,,There’s no need to hurry.
1072,,You’ll die soon enough.
1073,,"Ha, ha. It’s too soon."
1074,,I have something special prepared for you.
1075,,"You’ll learn about it soon enough. Ha, ha."
1076,,No one can stop me!!!
1077,,H-hey!
1078,,T-this headache! It’s so painful!
1079,,Hey! Are you alright?
1080,,Don’t touch me!
1081,,He will soon awaken...
1082,,There will be a signal.
1083,,Everyone get ready!
1084,,Yah!
1085,,What is it? Is it the signal?!
1086,,It’s the signal!
1087,,"Everyone, charge!!!"
1088,,Drive the Orcs out of Windawood!
1194,,Out of Soulshots. Buy more at the Shop.
1195,,Try leveling up equipment at the Forge.
1196,,You have excess Skill Points. Go put them to good use!
1197,,Out of HP Potions. Buy more at the Shop.
1198,,Out of MP Potions. Buy more at the Shop.
1199,,You’re straying off the path of the main quest!
1200,,Why don’t you try using Auto-Quest?
1201,,You have enough Rune Fragments to Imprint!
1549,,Need a little advice? We’re here for you!
1558,,Is that new equipment? Let’s go auto equip it!
1714,,I command you!
1715,,"You evil, unbodied spirit!"
1716,,Leave this world forever!
1717,,Incredible energy!!!
1718,,Ugh! W-what is it?!
1719,,H-help...
1720,,Be careful! Stay back!
1721,,Hehehe... You seem fun to play with.
1722,,You filthy spawn of darkness! Die!!!
1723,,The dark mystic has summoned a demon!!!
1724,,We need to get rid of it!
1725,,"Mwahaha, got some nice materials!"
1726,,"As expected, this statue was hit with a Mana Shard when Beleth was sealed."
1727,,Look at this. Isn’t it odd?
1728,,Huh? What is this?!
1729,,Beleth’s Mana is once again...
1730,,You there.
1731,,Huh? Who is it?
1732,,Prying Ivory Tower Wizards!
1733,,"Arggh!!!
W-what are you guys?!"
1734,,"It’s as they always say about curiosity killing the cat.
Foolish Wizards..."
1735,,I don’t have a good feeling about this...
1736,,Get ready!
1737,,Kill him and we’ll get the bounty!
1738,,Mmm? H-huh? Argghh!
1739,,"W-what is it!
H-help!!!"
1740,,Hmph... You guys are worthless.
1741,,Die! Staris!
1742,,"U-ugh...
Am I still alive?"
1743,,Damn it. Did I fail?!
1744,,We’ll hope for next time! Staris!
1745,,I went into the Captain’s Barracks earlier and saw dried meat.
1746,,Plunder everything here! Hahaha!
1747,,So? What about the goods?
1748,,It’s here.
1749,,"Until next time, then."
1750,,@2775
1751,,Over there!
1752,,Ahhhhh! Get him!
1753,,We need to run away!
1754,,Gasp!
1755,,Gasp! I almost died!
1756,,That way! Hurry!
1757,,"Meow, meow, whoa! Spears just keep coming!"
1758,,Arrghhh!!!
1759,,Grab them!
1760,,Kill them if you can’t grab them!
1761,,Hurry! Run! There are no Lizardmen out front!
1762,,Oh no... I said too much...
1763,,We’re done for meow...
1764,,Over there... Elie’s energy...
1765,,O-oh no! We need to run.
1766,,Hahaha. There’s nowhere to run...
1767,,Uhh... Elie...
1768,,Hehe. That’s right. I stored it here...
1769,,Look at this! It’s the key!
1770,,Wow - this child thinks she can actually escape? How foolish. Heh.
1771,,We’ll need to handle her carefully since she’s very valuable. I almost forgot for a second!
1772,,"Well then, shall we go to Cruma Tower?"
1773,,U-ughhh... Elie…
1774,,I hear the Silverlight Mercenaries have already made it deep into the Swampland.
1775,,You guys will need to buy me some time.
1776,,Don’t let anything past. Okay?
1777,,As you wish.
1778,,"Now, shall we go see Ellie?"
1779,,We’re almost there! Hang in there a little longer!
1780,,Hahaha... You imbeciles!
1781,,"Oh, Demon... Devour them and leave nothing behind!"
1782,,You lucked out! Ahahaha!
1783,,Fire! There’s a fire! There’s a fire here!!!
1784,,Fire! Fire!
1785,,Shriek! Let go! Let go of me!
1786,,I think it’s over here! Hurry up!
1787,,E-Elie!!! Wake up! Come on!!!
1788,,"Oh, my... This reunion is bringing me to tears."
1789,,Huh? What’s this light?
1790,,"Theodore is here, too? Hehe!"
1791,,I’ve always enjoyed an audience!
1792,,Ahahaha! Cruma’s seal will finally be undone!!!
1793,,"Theodore, because of you, everything’s going according to plan. Hahahaha."
1794,,I have been told of one that has been taking us out. That one is you!
1795,,I don’t want to fight - just talk.
1796,,"Die, you!"
1797,,Wait!
1798,,"If you refuse to be calm, then I have no choice but to beat you down."
1799,,The Chief! The Chief is in danger!
1800,,Don’t interrupt!
1801,,"Now that I have your attention, can we talk?"
1802,,Hehehe... Stupid horseheads!
1803,,How dare you mock us! Get him!
1804,,We’ve got you!
1805,,We lost one.
1806,,Get him!
1807,,Let’s take a look.
1808,,Are things going according to plan?
1809,,Hmm.. I can’t believe you actually chased me…
1810,,Deal with him quietly.
1811,,You guys are cruel! I can’t believe the missing Tanor were here...
1812,,A cage! Thank goodness! There are survivors!
1813,,Wait a minute! We’ll open it soon!
1814,,H-huh? W-what is it?!
1815,,"Guys! It’s me, Borys! Get a grip! It’s me!"
1816,,C-could it be... Why is there a Black Willow here?
1817,,Ha! Fools.
1818,,"They gather together, not knowing they’ll soon die."
4803,,"Look for yourselves! It is Guillotine, the Lord of the Keep of Agony!"
4804,,You fools are all... Argh!!!
4805,,Guillotine... W-why??
4806,,Your final task is to use your blood and release me!
1820,,Oh no! They’re here!
1821,,The Guillotine of Death himself has come!
1822,,Hehe... It seems it’s isn’t too late yet.
1823,,@2426
1824,,Get ready! We must protect the furnace!
1825,,It’s almost ready! Hang on a bit longer!!!
1826,,Return to the darkness from whence you came!
1827,,Disappear!!!
1828,,Arrrghhh!!!
1829,,"This... This isn’t over!
I’ll be waiting in the Ruined Keep!!!"
1832,@104,"There’s a special device on the bridge!
Protect me while I activate it!"
1833,@104,"Once I do that, the bridge will activate
and we’ll be able to escape!"
1834,@104,"We were able to cross the bridge safely thanks to you.
I’ll compensate you handsomely."
1835,@104,"Oh! Remember, I’ll pay you more based
on how many Holy Artifacts are activated!"
1836,@104,@1832

1859,@2365,There! It’s that guy!!!
1860,@2365,They set fire to the food!
1861,@2365,Kill! Kill!!!
1862,,How dare you show your face again after that failure?!
1863,,Get those monsters out of here!
1864,,What are you doing? Attack!
1865,,"But... but chancellor, our platoon is barely holding together. They need rest!"
1866,,Fool! Are you talking back to me?
1867,,"If you defy me, I’ll cut you down where you stand!"
1868,,And - I’ll enslave your families!
1869,,Enslave them?!
1870,,"Are you really so heartless?!
You’re marching us to our deaths!"
1871,,How dare you!!!
1872,,You dare raise your hand against the chancellor?!
1873,,"I’m wasting my breath! Dirty traitors!
Kill them all!"
1874,,"Damn it! Either way, we’re dead men!"
1875,,Save the platoon leader!
2500,,Run away!
2501,,"Over here! 
This way. Hurry!"
2502,,"Quickly, quickly!"
2503,,That was risky.
2504,,"The record was damaged very recently.
The Dark Mystic must be involved."
2505,,We need to tell Hardin soon.
2506,,Who’s there? Show yourself!
2507,,Theodore
2508,,"Haven’t I taught you that
curiosity will get you killed?"
2509,,Wait.
2510,,"We still have a long way to go -
let’s take a short rest."
2511,,W-what is it?!
2512,,Don’t resist and no one will get hurt.
2513,,Stop them!
2514,,Now we’re all dead.
2515,,"You lot!
Do you have any idea who I am?"
2516,,The execution ritual will now begin!
2517,,It is time! Die!
2518,,How are my skills?
2519,,"Don’t be conceited, you meathead.
There’s no time!"
2520,,"How dare they interrupt the ritual!
Kill them!"
2521,,"Well, get ready, Lyle."
2522,,I’ll leave all these dregs to you.
2523,,W-what is this?!
2524,,"I wanted to see how
great a Lesser Giant is..."
2525,,Oh! A worthy opponent!
2526,,"We’ve finally succeeded, Beleth."
2527,,Open! Door of Gnosis!
2528,,Finally... The knowledge of the Lesser Giants will be mine!
2529,,"Feldheim, what is this?!"
2530,,"As expected, he must have deteriorated over time..."
2531,,"Useless!
I’ve gone through all this trouble because of this fool!"
2532,,Kill him now! NOW!
2533,,"Oh, no! We need to save him!"
2534,,Alright! Just a little further! Run!
2535,,Did you think you could leave so easily?
2536,,Razorlimb!
2537,,Destroy them all!
2538,,Arrogant fools! What do you think you’re doing?!
2539,,"Shut up!
You’re no longer our captain!"
2540,,D-damn it!
2541,,I can’t die such a sudden
2542,,death...
2543,,No... one... can get rid... of me!
2544,,"Oh, darling Ashear.
You should greet the captain personally!"
2545,,"Ashear!
Elizabeth stop this!"
2546,,"Captain!
It’s dangerous for you to get close!"
2547,,Ashear.
2548,,"Don the power of darkness and be reborn
as a loyal knight of Beleth!"
2549,,"It was Elizabeth, those vile things have tricked us again!"
2550,,"Oh, no. Did they take out the guard captain?"
2551,,Yes. I did it.
2552,,All preparations are complete!
2553,,"Be careful.
He’s no longer the guard captain!"
2554,,"Now, Theodore!"
2555,,Great!
2556,,It’s done!
2557,,"We sealed part of the
Giant’s energy!"
2558,,"Protect us while I activate
the Teleportation Stone!"
2559,,There are too many enemies!
2560,,"Done!
The Magic Circle is activated!"
2561,,"Cara!
Come quickly! Hurry up!"
2562,,"Ahem.
Bug off if you aren’t going to buy items meow."
2563,,"Aw, come on. Give me a better price for it."
2564,,"Wyrms!
Wyrms have appeared!"
2565,,Wyrm! Why are Wyrms attacking this place?!
2566,,"Well, then.
Let us have some fun now. Shall we?"
2567,,"Go on now, let us see how you entertain me."
2568,,"You’re stronger than I expected,
but this is where things end."
2569,,We can’t let things end like this.
2570,,"I... will...
Get rid... of you!"
2571,,Agh! This can’t be!
2785,@2318,Drat! They’re Veremus’s minions!
2786,@2318,"One of Veremus’s minions, Kargos, probably has the ring!"
2787,@2318,"As expected, these guys aren’t pushovers!"
2788,@2318,I’ll increase your wages! Hang in there a bit longer!
2789,Kargos,"How dare a Human
come here?!"
2790,@2789,Burn and die!!!
2791,@2318,"Hey! Shut up, you lizard!
Hand over my ring!"
2792,@2437,I can’t do it by myself!!!
2793,@2437,I need your help!!!
2794,@2437,These guys look like the advance party!
2795,@2437,Let’s deal with them quickly!
2796,@2437,Seems we’ve dealt with almost all of them!
2797,Veren,If I remember my abduction correctly...
2798,Veren,The Shamans must have taken the wagon.
2799,Veren,Defeat the Shamans and look for my wagon!
2800,Veren,There!!! My wagon is over there!
2801,Veren,T-the Orcs are coming!!!
2802,Veren,These damned Orcs! Die!!!
2803,Veren,Get away from my wagon!
2804,Cago,That wagon is mine!
2805,Cago,Hand over the wagon!!!
2806,Cago,Cago!!!
2807,Veren,We need to find where the Orcs took my stuff!
2808,Veren,"Let’s defeat them, and then look for my things!"
2809,Veren,Found it! They’ve been hoarding loot in that barrack!
2810,Veren,Let’s go! Time’s a wasting!
2811,Veren,It’s them! They’re coming!
2812,Veren,Come on! Protect me!
2813,Veren,I can’t die here!
2814,Kuta,Human! You prisoners dare touch our loot?
2815,Kuta,Kill the Human!
2816,@1510,It’ll be good to warm up before fighting that guy.
2817,@1510,Let’s defeat some Orcs!
2818,@1510,I’m all warmed up! Let’s go!
2819,@1510,He should be there!
2820,Pokas,Who’s poking around my post?!
2821,Pokas,"Hey, men!"
2822,Pokas,Bring me his head!
2823,@1510,About time you stepped up!
2824,@1510,I’m sick and tired of Orcs!
2825,@1510,@1221
2826,Buhill,Yay!
2827,@2826,Thank you!
2828,@2826,"Get rid of them quickly, please!"
2829,@2826,"According to rumors, there’s a Windsus matriarch!"
2830,@2826,"We need to defeat Mambo, the mother of Windsuses!"
2831,@2826,"If we don’t, she’ll just keep having babies!"
2832,@2826,Find and eliminate Mambo!
2833,@2826,I-it’s... Mambo!!!
2834,@2826,The babies are coming!!!
2835,@2826,She’s so big!!!
2836,@2826,I guess she’s not the matriarch for no reason!
2837,@2826,"Die, Windsus!!!"
2838,@2826,The Basilisks should be to the northwest!
2839,@2826,Their waists are their weakness!
2840,@2826,Aim for their waists and they’ll go down easy!
2841,@2826,I found the Basilisk eggs!
2842,@2826,Destroy their eggs!
2843,@2826,"Oh, no! The Basilisks are coming!"
2844,@2826,@499
2845,@2826,N-no!
2846,@2826,That’s a gigantic Basilisk!!!
2847,@2826,Gasp... I didn’t know Basilisks could grow that large!
2848,@2826,It’s all or nothing!
2849,@2826,Hyaaa!
2850,Jaid,The ancient Dragon skeleton is surrounded by a horde of Grandis!
2851,@2850,Be careful! The Grandis won’t just stand by!
2852,@2850,It’ll be good to defeat the Grandis first!
2853,@2850,Seems we’ve defeated enough of the Grandis.
2854,@2850,Hurry! Bring me the skeleton!
2855,Grandis,Intruder!!! Kill!!!
2856,Zakum,@1382
2857,@2856,"I’ll display your skeleton, too!"

2859,Lawrence,You want to find some Dark Diamonds?
2860,@2859,Defeat the Saharas over there.
2861,@2859,"Well, I didn’t even get a look."
2864,@2859,Thank you!
2865,@2859,L-look over there!!! Saharas!!!
2866,@2859,I-I haven’t even been able to buy a home!
2867,@2859,T-the spirit of Sahara!
2868,@2859,I can’t believe I’m seeing it with my own eyes!
2869,@2859,So my journey ends here...
2870,Kutcher,Kaimbell’s home is surrounded by a horde of Headless Knights!
2871,@2870,I wish you luck!
2872,@2870,Hehe. Try not to die!
2873,Kaimbell,Is it an intruder?!
2874,@2873,Salier... Salier?
2875,@2873,How dare you betray me?!

2879,@2873,Arrrghhh!
2880,Veren,If I remember my abduction correctly...
2881,Veren,The Shamans must have taken the wagon.
2882,Veren,Defeat the Shamans and look for my wagon!
2883,Veren,There!!! My wagon is over there!
2884,Veren,T-the Orcs are coming!!!
2885,Veren,These damned Orcs! Die!!!
2886,Veren,Get away from my wagon!
2887,Veren,We need to find where the Orcs took my stuff!
2888,Veren,"Let’s defeat them, and then look for my things!"

2891,Veren,It’s them! They’re coming!
2892,Veren,Come on! Protect me!
2893,Veren,I can’t die here!

2895,@1510,Let’s defeat some Orcs!
2896,@1510,I’m all warmed up! Let’s go!
2897,@1510,He should be there!
2898,@1510,"Oh, no! Seems we’re fallen into a trap!"
2899,@1510,I don’t see Pokas! And they’re coming at us!
2900,@1510,Prepare for battle!

2959,@2650,"T-thank you!!!
The captain sent you?!"
2960,@2650,"Cover our backs!
I’ll go ahead to see the captain!"
2961,@2650,Be careful of Warden Kenbell!!!
2962,Warden Kenbell,How dare you release our sacrifices for Zaken?!
2963,@2962,I’ll turn you into a sacrifice!
2964,@2962,@2876
2965,Linfield,This officer has been chasing after Stenoa for years.
2966,Linfield,Stenoa is one of the most dangerous beings in all of Aden.
2967,Linfield,We first decided to eliminate Stenoa’s minions.
2968,Linfield,"We found Ellen, one of them."
2969,Linfield,Our mission is to defeat Ellen.
2970,Linfield,"Before that, we need to cut down Ellen’s minions."
2971,Linfield,"If we set fire to Medusa’s hair,"
2972,Linfield,Ellen’s minions should gather.
2973,@831,What are you burning?!
2974,@831,Arrogant fool! I won’t let you live!
2975,Ellen,What a rude challenge...
2976,@831,They slaughtered our sisters and set fire to their hair!
2977,Ellen,"Let’s repay the debt, sisters!"
2978,Linfield,Ellen’s here in the flesh! This is even better than our plan!
2979,Giltinae,Guard! Guard!
2980,Laima,Shriek! Bear! There’s a bear!
2981,Gardner,"What did you bring, huh?"
2982,@2981,"I told you to hunt bears, not to bring one!"
2983,@2981,Don’t back off! We need to stop it!
2984,@2981,Is that red one the boss?
2985,@2981,Seems this situation will be solved if we defeat him!
2986,@2850,Succubi Mana has a mysterious power.
2987,@2850,"Apply a bit of it, and it’ll serve as an anesthetic."
2988,Mystic Weaver,"Found it, master! Over here!"
2989,@2850,Darn it! They found me! Protect me!
2990,@2988,Kill anyone who interrupts!
2991,Deathfire,"Jaid... You were there, huh... I’ll go soon..."
2992,@2850,Hmph...!
2993,@2991,Seems you’ve been extending your life by harassing the Succubi Jaid.
2994,@2991,You just need to accept the lord...
2995,@2850,Stop this nonsense! Get out of here!
2996,@2991,Her time is eternal. You will lose.
2997,@2850,"Hmph! How noisy! Hey, shut his mouth!"
2998,@2991,"I’ll see you again, Jaid... Hehehe..."
2999,Jean,Hey! Look at me!
3000,@2999,It’s because of the Windsus!
3001,@2999,The Antelope was pushed back to near the castle gate!
3002,@2999,Chase after the Windsus!
3003,@2999,It’s Great Black!
3004,@2999,This is who’s been causing all the trouble!
3005,@2999,He chased off the Antelope!
3006,@2999,Everything would be better if he just disappeared!
3007,@2999,Thank you! Please give my regards to Royce!
3008,@2999,It’s a mess here! This time...
3009,@2999,"The Antelopes, not the Windsuses, are running wild!"
3010,@2999,It’s the first time I’ve seen the Antelope males stampede like this!
3011,@2999,Their excitement is spreading!
3012,@2999,I can’t believe this ruckus!
3013,@2999,"Gray Hoof, along with Great Black, is one of the two strongest animals around."
3014,@2999,He’s the strongest male Antelope around here!
3015,Elder Dicor,You jerks! You really think I’ll let you get away?
3016,@3015,"This time, you can be the hunted!"
3017,Queen Dicor,Pay the price for attacking Dicor!
3018,@3017,I’ll be taking your life!
3019,Langk Lizardman Ranger,Find the enemy and surround them! Shhhk!
3020,@3019,Found the rodent! Squash it now! Shhhk!
3021,@3019,There will be no prisoners! No mercy either! Shhhk!
3022,Kazeeb,What are you doing? Get him! Shhhk!
3023,@3019,Get at least an arm and a leg! Shhhk!
3024,@3022,The head is mine! Shhhk!
3025,Langk Lizardman Elder Shaman,Over there! That guy over there!
3026,@3025,@1759
3027,@3025,You rodent!
3028,@3025,Prepare yourself! I’m gonna rearrange your organs so you eat through your anus!
3029,Crotoa,What’s this ruckus? What a mess!
3030,@3029,You lot can’t even deal with a couple of pipsqueaks!
3031,@3029,"What Elder Shaman are you claiming to be?! Shut up, all of you!"
3032,@3029,I’ll deal with it!
3033,@2870,I trust you won’t be taken out by a Wyrm.
3034,@2870,"I have no interest in whether you live or die,"
3035,@2870,but I’d hate to get off-schedule.
3036,Exteel,Shrieeeeek!!!
3037,@2870,Ah! That’s wonderful to hear! I’ll keep my expectations up!
3038,Todd,Over there! I hear the cries of Ruin Snipes!
3039,Todd,They’re charging in all at once.
3040,Todd,Are you alright?
3041,Todd,Catch the leader if you see it!
3042,Todd,The client will be extremely happy.
3043,Todd,That also means good rewards!

4002,@4000,Whoa! Ferocious!
4003,@4000,"I bet it tastes
delicious!"
4004,@4000,Hurry! Get more!
4005,@4000,I think we have enough meat.
4006,@4000,You’ll need fire if you plan on cooking.
4007,@4000,There should be firewood nearby.
4008,@4000,My lord may be displeased if we only have bear meat.
4009,@4000,Please bring back some Windsus meat as well.
4010,@4000,Help me! Help! There are Grendels everywhere!
4011,@4000,Go away! Go away!
4012,@4000,Eek! You damn bears! Are you crazy?!
4013,@4000,Thank you for saving me!
4014,@4000,Wh... What the heck is that huge bear?!
4015,@4000,Looks delicious!
4016,@4000,There are so many bears!
4017,@4000,My lord will be overjoyed!
4018,Annie,Don’t bother with the middling ones!
4019,@4018,Get me something large - something gigantic!!!
4020,@4018,That’s what I need!
4021,@4018,Those starving Grendels are such an eyesore... I can’t concentrate on cooking like this!
4022,@4018,"Get them too while you’re at it, will you?"
4023,@4018,Catching a Windsus is a handful as is!
4024,@4018,Do let me know if you spot any large Windsus tracks!
4025,@4018,Do you see that?
4026,@4018,"Those large footprints
can only belong
to a gigantic Windsus!"
4027,@4018,I think we’re close to finding it.
4028,@4018,"Gasp!!!
It must be a mother Windsus."
4029,@4018,"As for the babies,
we can barbecue them!
I’m sure they’ll be tasty!"
4030,@4018,The mother! The mother is here!
4031,@4018,Hurry up and finish her off!
4032,@4018,I’m gonna take cover... this is scary!
4033,Renner,Let me know if you spot a dark cloak while you’re fighting the Bugbears!
4034,@4033,"It was
Shayden’s favorite cloak..."
4035,@4033,"Found the cloak!
Quick! Over here!"
4036,@4033,Argh!!! Bugbears!!!
4037,@4033,"Did they set traps, too?"
4038,@4033,Shayden!
4039,@4033,I-it’s him! That hideous face!
4040,@4033,I’d know it anywhere!
4041,@4033,I’ll defeat him for sure!
4042,@4033,P-protect me!
4043,@4033,Defeat everything you see!
4044,@4033,They’ll destroy the town!
4045,@4033,I found the cloak! Shayden!!! Shayden!!!
4046,@4033,Argh! They’re coming!!!
4047,@4033,Forget revenge! My life is more important!!!
4048,@4033,Help me out!!!
4049,Drave,"First, defeat the fighter by the armory!!!"
4050,@4049,"We must move
quickly and precisely."
4051,@4049,I’ve dealt with all the lookouts.
4052,@4049,Now it’s time to take the weapons from the armory.
4053,@4049,Hurry! Take the weapons!
4054,Oren Soldier,Drave! Aren’t you Drave?

4058,@4054,W-we’ve been spotted! Run!!!
4059,@4057,Feeble human!
4060,@4057,We will kill you!!!
4061,Bugbear of Greed,"You haven’t taken care of
those petty thieves yet?"
4062,@4061,All these weapons are mine!
4063,@4061,I’ll destroy anyone who touches them!
4064,@2850,"Well, now it seems to have your attention."
4065,@2850,Well done.
4066,@2850,Deal with the nearby Nymphs.
4067,@2850,They can be a hassle.
4068,@2850,The Prinsis I mentioned is here. It’s a large white flower!
4069,@2850,Hurry! Now!
4070,Nymph,"Oh, my... You like me that much?"
4071,@2850,"Oh, no! It’s a trap! Hurry - get out of there!"
4072,@4070,Listen carefully and do as I say.
4073,@4070,Just sleep already!
4074,@2850,The Prinsis over there seems real!
4075,@2850,@4069
4076,@4070,"As expected. You like me, don’t you? Haha!"
4077,@2850,Another fake! I can’t believe this. Get out of there.
4078,@2850,We can’t help it if we die.
4079,@4070,Shouldn’t you pay the price for trying to kill the flower?
4080,@4070,Die already!
4081,@2850,Th-this one is legitimate. I’m sure this one’s the real deal.
4082,@2850,Grab the flower already!
4083,Nymph Queen,I’m impressed he shook off the hallucination!
4084,@4083,I’ll kill you myself!
4085,@4083,This Prinsis will grow larger with your blood!
4086,@2294,It will be good to defeat the Lizardmen first!
4087,@2294,They treasure their eggs very dearly!
4088,@2294,Many have attempted to steal their egg before - and died trying!
4089,@2294,This should be fine!
4090,@2294,Stop making a ruckus and bring that egg over here!
4091,@2294,"Bring back a clean one, not one tainted with dark magic!"
4092,Leto Lizardman Priest,"Intruder!
Kill him! Shhhk!!!"
4093,@4092,"Death to all
egg thieves!"
4094,Leto Lizardman Guardian,"Death!
Death!
Death!"
4095,Manager Tantaka,What are you doing?
4096,@4095,"You let that
fool get near
the egg?"
4097,@4095,You ingrates!
4098,@4095,I’ll rip you to shreds!
4099,Shayden,There! Deal with the infiltrators!
4100,@4099,Be wary - they have quick hands!
4101,@4099,Uh oh... they’re headed my way! HELP!
4102,@4099,Argh! Help!!!
4103,@4099,The Lizardmen are coming!!!
4104,@4099,I should’ve just gone home!
4105,Tanguri,This human’s perfect for sacrifice!
4106,@4099,T-Tanguri!!!
4107,@4099,"After them!
I have a great reward for whoever catches them!"
4108,@2318,I’ll look for a way to deal with their numbers.
4109,@2318,"First, deal with the nearby elite soldiers!"
4110,@2318,Oh!!! They’re sleeping in the barracks.
4111,@2318,This is our chance! Set fire to the barracks!
4112,Timak Orc Elite Soldier,@2775
4113,Timak Orc Trooper,I smell something burning!
4114,@4113,M-my hair is on fire!
4115,@4112,Die!
4116,Search Adviser Kamodu,How dare you set fire to the barracks?!
4117,@4116,I’ll rend you limb from limb!
4118,@2318,"Whoa - who is this guy?!
Looks like he’s in charge around here!"
4119,@2318,Let’s capture him! That should tank their morale!
4120,@2289,They’re all over the armory!
4121,@2289,Defeat the Tanor first!
4122,@2289,"Grab their weapons, too!"
4123,@2289,There! The armory!
4124,@2289,Hurry meow! Let’s search for the Mace of Punishment!
4125,Tanor Silenos,A cat?! Here?!
4126,@4125,You must be out of your mind!
4127,@4125,I’ll catch you and make you my pet!
4128,Blacksmith Kanto,"Eh? Who’s there!
Who’s making all that ruckus?"
4129,@2289,"There!
That Tanor is holding
the Mace of Punishment!"
4130,@2289,"That!!!
Steal that!!!"
4131,@2289,Steal it!!!
4132,@2442,Let’s deal with the minions first!
4133,@2442,These guys don’t have much fight in them!
4134,@2442,There! The Chief’s Token! Let’s take that first!
4135,@2442,Careful! They’ll charge in to take the Chief’s Token!
4136,@4125,How dare a human touch the Chief’s Token!
4137,@4125,We’ll show you the might of the Tanor Silenos!
4138,Honor Fighter Vartis,Wait! Hold it! They’re holding the Chief’s Token.
4139,@4138,They should join the fight.
4140,@4138,"Not that they’ll last long, heh!"
4141,@4138,Fight fair and square.
4142,High Shaman Varpio,I’ll deal with you...
4143,@4142,Have a taste of my magic!!!
4144,@4138,"Not too shabby, facing off against Varpio."
4145,@4138,I’ll deal with you myself!
4146,@4138,I won’t go down easy.
4147,Backup Chief Beto,Ha! Weaklings.
4148,@4147,I expected you to lose quickly!
4149,@4147,Bring it on! I’ll take you on!
4150,@4000,I see the Windsuses!!!
4151,@4000,I’ll warm up the grill!!!
4152,@4000,Looks like meat’s back on the menu!
4153,@4000,That guy! Jeez! What’s his problem?
4154,@4000,The stress is no joke!
4155,@4018,Here we go!
4156,@4018,"Quick, grab more! We need more herbs!"
4157,@4018,There are a lot more quality herbs than expected!
4158,@4018,Here we go!
4159,@4018,Mmm... Smells good!
4160,@4018,Hehe! This should be enough!
4161,@4033,"It’s unlikely, but let me know if you find it!"
4162,@4033,A Bugbear wearing an apron...?
4163,@4033,Ha! Don’t be ridiculous.
4164,@4049,I’ll start a fire while you deal with the Bugbears.
4165,@4049,We must move swiftly and precisely!
4166,@2219,Be careful! Nymphs are quite violent!
4167,@2850,Over there.
4168,@2850,Please collect their fangs!
4169,@2850,Be careful of the venom!
4170,@2850,You could be killed instantly if you don’t watch out!
4171,@4099,"I would collect them myself, but..."
4172,@4099,Oh! If only I hadn’t twisted my ankle! Darn.
4173,@4099,Renner’ll definitely be surprised when he sees I defeated a fighter!
4174,@1510,Be careful of their horns!
4175,@1510,Hmm. So that’s how they fight!
4176,@1510,I thought he’d be stronger!
4177,@1510,Ahha!
4178,@2318,Try persuading them!
4179,@2318,He doesn’t seem like much of a talker.
4180,@2318,"Well, we don’t have much of a choice..."
4181,@2318,Now we need to defeat all of them...
4182,@2442,Thank you! I’m a little busy dealing with everyone else.
4183,@2442,These small fries sure are a hassle!
4184,@2219,You must collect a Nymph’s tears when it dies!
4185,@2219,Be quick when you defeat Nymphs!
4186,@2219,Now! Do it now!
4187,@2294,There! It’s him!
4188,@2294,That menacing look!
4189,@2294,(Startled!)
4190,@2294,Take the egg quickly meow!
4191,@4099,Be careful not to destroy the Bone Headgear!
4192,@4099,There! The Bone Headgear fell!
4193,@4099,Don’t forget anything!
4194,@1510,Damn Orcs!
4195,@1510,I’ll make sure we get our vengeance!
4196,@1510,@2300
4197,@1510,"Those damn, dirty Orcs!"
4198,@1510,I’ll defeat as many as I can!
4199,@1510,Hyaa!
4200,@2318,Defeat the Elite Soldier!
4201,@2318,I’m certain we’ll find keepsake!
4202,@2318,About ten should please the bereaved.
4203,@2289,Be careful!!!
4204,@2289,I’ll dock your pay if the leather is damaged!
4205,@2289,"Be careful not to get any blood on it, either!"
4206,@2442,Try not to damage the horn!
4207,@2442,Any damage done to it translates to mana lost!
3375,Tyron,I haven’t been able to contact the Ivory Tower Wizards since they made this request.
3376,@3375,I wonder if something happened at the Ivory Tower...
3377,@3375,"Regardless, we can’t ignore their request."
3378,@3375,That should be plenty! Quick. Set it on fire!
3379,@3375,He might show up if we’re lucky!
3380,@3375,The monsters are here! Deal with them quickly!
3381,@3375,They sure are some tough cookies!
3382,Angsra,Hmm! What is this?
3383,@3382,You arrogant hoodlum!
3384,@3382,How dare you burn my seal?
3385,@3382,The price of your ignorance will be death!
3386,Lady Nine,There’s almost no chance to enter the interior of the Sea of Spores.
3387,@3386,The prices of the objects found only here...
3389,@3386,"You get the picture without me having to spell it out, right?"
3390,@3386,This is your chance to get things even the Cat Caravan can’t get their hands on!
3391,@3386,There are two types of Obsidian Golems.
3392,@3386,The one I found is older and more powerful!
3488,@3386,Wait! I think I’ve found signs of an ancient Obsidian Golem.
3393,Ancient Obsidian Golem,Fool! How dare you wake me from my slumber?
3394,@3386,Yikes! I guess it wasn’t dead?
3395,Jaka,You greedy fools never change...
3396,@3395,Your kind should be extinct by now!
3397,@3395,You’ll meet the same end as the others!
3489,@2374,This way! I could hear you fighting from all the way over there!
3398,@2374,Hah! Material that finds itself - this is great!
3399,@2374,I’ll pay you less if I have to get involved.
3400,@2374,"You wouldn’t want that to happen, right?"
3401,Tarugal,Roar!!! Who hit my servant?
3402,@3401,"Hey, you! Get over here! I’ll rough you up to ease my boredom!"
3403,@2374,That guy’s massive!
3404,@2374,Hey! Aren’t you going to run?
3405,@2374,Don’t push yourself too hard! What’s the point if you die?
3491,@2289,Did you find anything useful?
3406,Oel Mahum Supplier,There! Over there!
3407,@3406,We’ll catch you! You damn thief!
3408,@2289,Meow! This is nice meow! They must have chased us for a reason!
3409,@2289,This must be something useful!
3410,Hammertooth,Roar!
3411,@2289,Meow! My eardrums! Why so loud?!
3412,@3410,Merchants? And small fries? Are you kidding me?!
3413,@2289,Kill all noisy Oel Mahums!
3414,@3410,Muahaha! Your hides’ll make some nice slippers!
3415,@2289,A merchant only partakes in profitable deals!
3416,@2289,You’re just as loud as you are large! Why don’t you be a damn slipper!
3417,Jayhan,I can’t even remember how long I’ve been like this for!
3418,@3417,It’s a miracle that I’ve kept my sanity.
3419,@3417,It’s because I’m such a great dark mystic.
3420,@3417,Anyone else would’ve gone mad!
3421,@3417,Oh! I fell asleep! Hmm? Be careful! An enemy!
3422,Oel Mahum Shaman,Who dares touch the Crystal of Activation!
3423,@3422,Hurry up! We need to deal with this before Jenis finds out!
3424,@3417,Huh? Did they say Jenis?
3425,Jenis,That dumb Jayhan really doesn’t know when to quit.
3426,@3417,Jenis? Is that Jenis?
3427,@3425,Yea dummy! You’ve been chased out. Don’t you get it?
3428,@3417,What did you say? What? Why? Why do I have to do that?
3429,@3425,I have no obligation to answer you. Hehehe...
3430,@3425,You will experience a wonderful and eternal life... Hehehe...
3431,@3417,This is ridiculous! I’m innocent! Don’t do this!
3432,@3425,They helped that dummy Jayhan. Those dumb Silverlight Mercenaries...
3433,Votang,I trust you will know what to do as you are experienced with this matter.
3434,@3433,Over there - that looks like the bag that was stolen from me.
3435,Oel Mahum Petty Thief,Hmm? Hey! What are you doing?
3436,@3435,A thief? Or an idiot? Maybe both?
3437,@3433,"Hey, that’s mine! You damn thieves!"
3438,@3435,Hehehe! Catch me if you can!
3439,Kuzran,What’s this ruckus about?
3440,@3433,Huh? He’s the one who ambushed me!
3441,@3439,Oh - that merchant sent you? I knew I should’ve finished him off!
3442,@3439,Repaying my mercy like this? Tsk. So ungrateful!
3443,@3433,Return my wife’s keepsake!
3444,@3439,No way! Finders Keepers!
3445,@3439,"Now, you and your minion will die!"
3446,@2294,Do you know about Nymphs?
3447,@2294,They are known for their beauty... but I have yet to see one.
3448,@2294,The object we are after will be the base material for a very expensive perfume.
3374,@2294,This way meow! Bring it quickly meow!
3449,@2294,Woah! Look over there! She looks beautiful... but dangerous!
3450,Mary Rose,Those guys dare attack us?
3451,@2294,We can’t give up the loot! That’s a huge payday!
3452,@3450,You dirty merchant! I’ll finish you off!
3453,Hallamari,Why are you bothering my sisters and me...?
3454,@3453,I can no longer remain silent about your evil deeds.
3455,@2294,Uh oh! This is dangerous!
3456,@2294,We need to beat them meow! We can’t give up on new items!
3457,@3453,You’re no better than a parasite as long as you’re helping those misers!
3458,Hanshen,This town used to be embroiled in turmoil.
3459,@3458,"Fortunately, the townsfolk were able to make it through those tough times."
3460,@3458,But I’m seriously worried this time.
3373,@3458,Defeating the minions isn’t going to do anything. We need to find the leader!
3461,Pan Luem,Kekeke! Prey!!!
3462,@3458,Be careful! They’re very aggressive!
3463,@3461,Mine! Mine! I’m going to kill them!
3464,Waika,"Wow, not bad. My minions might be dumb, but they’re not weak!"
3465,@3464,You will pay the price for killing my minions.
3466,@3464,Hang in there! Hahaha!
3467,@2219,This species is only found in the Sea of Spores.
3468,@2219,It has great academic value.
3372,@2219,Huh? I think that bag on the floor is mine.
3469,Spore Fungus,I knew you’d come back for your bag! You wicked creature!
3470,@2219,Huh? What’s going on?
3471,@3469,They’re the murderers! Get them!
3472,Fungurian,Roar!!!
3473,@2219,Don’t listen to the monsters!
3474,@2219,That big guy sure is unique!
3475,@2219,"I think he’ll be a good sample, don’t you?"
3476,Claire,The bailiff is different from most aristocrats.
3477,@3476,He enjoys fighting on the battlefield.
3478,@3476,"Even so, we need to deal with this - we don’t have much time."
3479,@3476,There is no telling when entry to this place will be restricted.
3371,@3476,Be careful with that jar. It’s bad news if it breaks.
3480,@3476,Huh? There’s something about this Seal Jar!
3481,Unbound Reaper,It’s the outside world!!! How dare you seal us up!!!
4208,@3481,Wait! Your soul looks delicious!
4209,@3481,Perfect timing! I was just in the mood for a snack!
3482,@3476,What?! There’s a monster coming out of the jar!
3483,@3476,"Oh, no! The jar cracked! Please defeat the monster!"
3484,Osner,"Woohoo! Fresh air! Farewell, damn jar!"
3485,@3476,Osner? Oh my! He escaped!
3486,@3484,Free at last! Hahaha! I’ll smash that damn jar!
3487,@3476,I told you to be careful with the jar! We’ll be in big trouble if that breaks!
3240,,You are not in the same channel as your party leader. Go to the party leader’s channel!
3673,@3651,Thank you for saving me.
4772,@195,You said your name is Molly? Tell your story. Take your time.
3674,@493,The Sea of Spores was a fierce battlefield in the past.
3675,@493,It was turned into a wasteland by powerful magic.
3676,@493,The Sea of Spores is toxic.
3677,@493,No ordinary creatures can live there.
3678,@493,It seems to be reacting to some sort of energy.
3679,@493,They seemed to have gained power because of the mutation.
3680,@195,You’re saying the magic caused the mutation?
3681,@493,"No, but it was sped up."
3682,@493,Mutation was already in progress.
3683,@195,To think Molly’s power could have such an effect...
4773,@195,Molly caused an explosion
4774,@195,while she was escaping the dark brotherhood.
4775,@195,That means... the explosion accelerated the mutation!
4776,@195,"I’m not sure why exactly the Dark Brotherhood is after Molly,"
4777,@195,but I’m certain we shouldn’t let them get their hands on her.
3684,@186,Hey! This way! Look at this!
3685,@186,There’s a big one over there!
3850,@186,A big one is coming. This is dangerous.
3686,@195,We need to gather the barrier device crystal fragments.
3687,@195,"We need to stop them from coming close, okay?"
3688,@195,Emon said we need those to restore the barrier device.
3689,@195,This way! Help! I’m being attacked!
3690,@195,Damn! Such brute strength!
3691,@195,They’re rampaging!
3692,@195,So they have no reason to destroy the barrier device?
3693,@195,Something’s fishy! Someone must be behind all this.
3694,@337,Spore flowers will bloom from your corpses!
3695,@195,What in the world are you saying? Take this!
3696,@195,Hurry! I’m supposed to meet Theodore up ahead!
3697,@195,Go ahead! I’ll deal with our tail!
3698,@186,Here! I found a survivor!
3699,@160,"Emon and Pan, protect Molly and the survivor!"
3700,@186,"M-me too! Can’t you protect me, too?"
3701,@186,Meow! Bring it on! We’re stronger than you guys!
3702,Oel Mahum Fighter,Krrr! That cat is mine!
3703,@3422,N-no! I called dibs! That cat is mine!
3704,@186,W-what’s going on? Get away from me!
3705,@493,So they knew about our cat merchant...
3706,@160,That means the shaman must be observing us.
3707,@493,"You’re a total merchant, aren’t you?"
3708,@186,"I’ll take that as a compliment, meow."
3709,@493,"Sure, take it however way you will."
3710,@160,"Everyone, time to move!"
3711,@3651,Theodore! The monsters are coming!
3712,@160,Ignore them and run.
3713,@493,"Ah, it’s an important task!"
3714,@3651,"I’ll help, too!"
3715,@186,Is there no other way? Meow!
3716,@493,Don’t lose focus.
3717,@493,"Everyone, give me strength!"
3718,@186,Meow! This wasn’t in our plans!
3719,@160,Ugh... My energy isn’t coming back.
3720,@186,Whoa! It’s gigantic!
3721,@493,We have to hold on!
3722,@112,Huh? The Oel Mahum and the Dark Brotherhood are in cahoots?
3723,@112,"On the bright side, now we understand the situation. There won’t be any more surprises."
3724,@186,The Oel Mahum have two masters.
3725,@186,Let’s take care of White Captain Labaki first.
3726,Labaki,You arrogant fools! How dare you challenge me!
3727,@3422,"Labaki, isn’t this for the better?"
3728,@3726,"Oh, yeah! I’ll take a big reward for myself while I’m at it! Hahaha!"
3729,@112,Uh oh! It seems you’re looking down at us!
3730,@112,Does this mean anything?
3731,@186,We need to show them that we’re stronger.
3732,@186,Now we deal with High Shaman Ukra!
3733,@186,We need to travel south a ways.
3734,@112,Do your best to ignore anyone who attacks from behind.
3735,@112,There will be no end to this if we deal with them individually.
3736,@112,"Hey merchant, why are you working so hard?"
3737,@186,Hardin made a special request of me.
3738,@186,There is no adventurer who has traveled Oren more than I have.
3739,@112,Hahaha. I see. Here I was thinking you found your sense of justice!
3740,@186,I’m not dumb! I don’t do anything if the pay’s not good.
3741,Ukra,Oh? You guys saved us the trouble of finding you!
3742,@112,Here we go! Who wants to die?
3743,@3741,You sure are reckless! I’ll kill you myself!
3744,@112,I’m afraid we’re only going to make him angrier...
3745,@186,Just trust me! This is why you have such a hard time!
3746,@112,I wonder if “flaunting” will have any effect...?
3747,@186,"There’s no one chasing us, right? Then we don’t have a problem!"
3748,Iron Tooth,"You may have come here on your own accord, but you won’t be free to leave as you wish!"
3749,@112,Pan! You said there were only two!
3750,@186,Meow meow! That’s not important right now!
3751,@3422,It’s him! He planted the flag!
3752,@3748,Labaki and Ukra were two of my favorites!
3753,@3748,I’ll skewer you all!
3754,@112,"Oh, my... I didn’t see things going this badly!"
3755,@186,Meow! What do we do? I’m scared!
3756,@3748,Die! You damn cat!
3757,@186,Eek!
3758,@112,Pan’s hurt! Let’s finish this - fast!
3759,@3702,Wipe them out!
3760,Gelan,Yeah! Pummel them to smithereens!
3761,@3702,"Yes, sir!"
3762,@195,"Where are you going, sir?"
3763,@3760,Gasp! W-who’s there?
3764,@195,I’m disappointed that you don’t know me!
3765,@195,"Remember this for the future, Dark Brotherhood!"
3766,@195,I’m Aymel of the Silverlight Mercenaries! Got it?
3767,@3760,Hmph! I did hear about a dumb girl!
3768,@3760,You’re no match for Elizabeth!
3769,@195,Elizabeth... How dare you speak that name in my presence!
3770,@195,You’ve made a mistake! Die!
3771,@3760,Argh! Damn it! What’s wrong with this girl?
3772,@493,Theodore! Who exactly is Molly?
3773,@160,"I’m as curious as you are, but I know one thing for certain:"
3774,@160,The Dark Brotherhood is after her.
3775,@493,What incredible magic... It’s a relief the magic circle held out.
3776,@493,Could I find out how exactly she is of use?
3777,@186,Be quiet! Do Ivory Tower Wizards not need filters?
3778,@493,"Oh, sir. I sincerely need some filters!"
3779,@160,"Hahaha... Think of this as the price of a filter, Emon."
3780,@160,I’ll go get Molly. We’ll catch up further in.
3781,@493,You know about that? I guess you aren’t simply a noisy cat.
3782,@186,You think the cat caravan hires just anyone?
3783,@493,"You didn’t know about this, did you?"
3784,@186,"I’m a merchant, not a prophet! Don’t be a smart aleck!"
3785,Parasite Zombie,Krrrr! Looks tasty!
3786,@493,"Uh... You’re not talking about me, right?"
3787,@186,I-I wouldn’t taste good!! I promise!
3788,@186,Meow! Put your backs into it! Do something!
3789,@186,They caught up to us! Meow!
3790,@112,Whoa! You were doing something fun here!
3791,@493,Whoa! Reinforcements!
3792,@195,Do one thing for Pan and he won’t stop asking for favors!
3793,Parasite Zombie Lord,Argh! Krrrr!
3794,@186,"This isn’t my fault! Do something, meow!"
3795,@112,Leave it to me!
3796,@112,"Careful, Aymel!"
3797,@195,Don’t you worry!
3798,@195,"Over here, you walking compost piles!"
3799,@3785,Arghhhhh!
3800,@195,Come here once you deal with those winged beasts!
3801,@186,This must be the device Emon mentioned.
3802,@337,Kill them all!
3803,@195,Hmph! More trouble for me!
3804,@186,Meow! I’m pushing myself too hard today!
3805,@493,Why exactly are you destroying the barrier device?!
3806,@3760,It’s your fault the Sea of Spores is like this!
3807,@3760,Hmph. I have no obligation to answer your questions.
3808,@3760,Either hand Molly over or die!
3809,@160,I’ll be right back. Please take care of Molly.
3810,@195,Leave it to me!
3811,@3651,"Don’t worry about me, Theodore."
3812,@493,I’ll use a Teleportation Stone to go there and back.
3813,@112,Hahaha. This is great! I was thinking about running.
3814,@195,Let’s go! We need to cross the bridge!
3815,@3760,Hehehe! Embrion sure is impressive!
3816,@3760,I didn’t think it would be this easy to break your ranks!
4778,@195,Don’t be foolish! They went to repair the barrier device.
4779,@3760,Foolish girl! You think the barrier device would break down on its own?
4780,@3760,I was told you’d scatter when the barrier device breaks!
4781,@195,Oh? So you thought this would be easy because I’m alone?
4782,@3760,"They trusted you, the weakest, to protect Molly! Hahaha!"
4783,@195,Laugh while you can!
4784,@3760,Bwahahaha!
3817,@3651,They’re not chasing us anymore.
3818,@3461,You dare kill our brethren?
3819,@3461,You must be insane!
3820,Starving Pan Luem,Perfect! My stomach was just starting to rumble.
3821,@3820,I’m gonna swallow you whole!
3822,@3425,The wardstone is over there. I’ll be on my way.
3823,@195,Cat Merchants are so professional!
3824,@186,Not all of us! I’m a credit to my profession.
3825,@3651,Isn’t effort all that matters?
3826,@186,Of course! And I’m good at what I do!
3827,@3458,Please defeat the vampire bats first.
3828,@3458,Monsters have been appearing non-stop since the storm.
3829,@3458,The situation here is more severe than at the graveyard.
3830,@186,Hurry back! I don’t have a good feeling about this!
3831,@337,Now you’re done for!
3832,@337,Kill them all!
3833,@112,Argh! What the heck? These guys are a ton stronger than anyone we’ve faced before!
3834,@337,"Well, looks like the kid gloves are off!"
3835,@160,The kid gloves were ever on...?
3836,@337,You don’t pose any kind of threat to Embrion!
3837,@2991,Hehehe... you’ve been a mere plaything!
3838,@2991,I highly doubt a fool such as yourself would understand. Hahaha.
3839,@160,Ahha! I see...
3840,@112,Wh-why are you doing this? Theodore!
3841,@160,Face them with everything!
3842,@160,Aymel and Molly are in danger!
3847,@186,We’ll follow you as soon as we retrieve Aymel and Molly!
4754,@186,The mushrooms are coming!
4755,@186,What did you do to the mushrooms?
4785,@3651,I’m worried about my grandpa. He’s alone.
4786,@195,"For now, let’s go to your old home."
4210,@3375,We aren’t sure what caused the accident at Ivory Tower.
4211,@3375,Let’s think about that after we’ve defeated the Dark Brotherhood.
4212,@3375,The Ivory Tower Wizards have sent a request for help.
4213,@3375,Go rescue the Ivory Tower Wizards and bring them here!
4214,Ivory Tower Wizard Rakan,Thank you! We thought we were done for!
4215,Dark Brotherhood High Priest,Who’s there?
4216,@4214,"Run away, quick!"
4217,@4214,One of our friends is collapsed over there!
4218,Ivory Tower Wizard Jaya,"Argh! No! I’m bait! Run, everyone!"
4219,Nabraham,This is why hunting is so great! Foolish humans! Hahaha
4220,@4219,Go! It’s time for some bloodshed!
4221,@3375,@4210
4222,@3375,@4211
4223,@3375,@4212
4224,@3375,@4213
4225,@4214,@4214
4226,@4215,@4215
4227,@4214,@4216
4228,@3476,Defeat as many Fallen Knights as possible!
4229,@3476,What’s that over there?
4230,@3476,Could that Soulstone have brought the Fallen Knights?
4231,Fallen Knight,Stop them from coming close to the Soulstone!
4232,@3476,We need to destroy that Soulstone!
4233,@2991,Uh oh! I feel our lord’s anger!
4234,@2991,Boost the Doll of Emptiness’s drive to maximum!
4235,@2991,Defeat the enemy quickly so we can restore the Soulstone!
4236,Doll of Emptiness,Argh!
4237,@3476,Oh my goodness! What do we do?!
4238,@3476,@4228
4239,@3476,@4229
4240,@3476,@4230
4241,@4231,@4231
4242,Bella,This recipe is for producing magic reagents... and sometimes we use it for cooking.
4243,@4242,Don’t get the wrong idea. It’s perfectly safe.
4244,@4242,"However, this recipe’s magical properties do tend to attract magical life forms..."
4245,@4242,It will be to your advantage to leave as soon as you find the recipe!
4246,@4242,As expected! The magic from the recipe is attracting Gargoyles!
4247,@4242,Take it somewhere safe!
4248,@4242,Nothing like this ever happened at the Ivory Tower!
4249,@4242,They don’t seem to be in their right mind!
4250,@4242,@4242
4251,@4242,@4243
4252,@4242,@4244
4253,@4242,@4245
4254,@4242,@4246
4255,@4242,@4247
4256,@1510,Defeat the Timak Orc Elite Soldiers first!
4257,@1510,Don’t show any mercy!
4258,@1510,You’ve done enough! Come join me and we’ll get out of here!
4259,@1510,Defeat anyone who gets close!
4260,Timak Orc Sentinel,Grab them!
4261,@1510,How ridiculous! You thought this would be enough to stop us?
4262,@1510,Perhaps we should have killed more of those darn Orcs.
4263,Sadistic Crugar,Darian! I see you’re still alive! Hehehe!
4264,@1510,I refuse to die before I kill you!
4265,@4263,Krrr! I’ll beat you halfway to death and have you begging for your life!
4266,@1510,I see you still have your sick fantasies! This is the end for you!
4267,@4263,"Ha! You’re powerless, but you sure act tough in front of your friends!"
4268,@1510,That’s it! Shut up and die!
4269,@1510,@4256
4270,@1510,@4257

4272,@1510,@4259
4273,@4260,@4260
4274,@1510,@4261
4275,@2294,It makes me uneasy to know Orcs are producing bombs...
4276,@2294,I’m worried they might make some that work...
4277,@2294,And I’m also worried about the duds.
4278,@2294,I can’t help that I’m curious!
4279,@2294,Here! There’s a bomb here!
4280,@2294,Hurry! Move it! Let’s get out of here!
4281,@2294,The Orcs have found us!
4282,@4260,Grr! How dare you steal the bomb!
4283,@2294,We didn’t steal it! We’re just borrowing it for ourselves!
4284,@4260,Are you kidding me? You damn rat! Grr!
4285,@2294,Rat? I’ll have you know I’m a CAT!
4286,@2294,"That’s a serious insult, meow!"
4287,@2294,Be careful with the bombs! We’re done for if it blows!
4288,Aton,You think you can run off with our bombs? Not a chance!
4289,@2294,They’re so stubborn! So much trouble for just a few bombs!
4290,@4288,"Well, you’re causing a lot of trouble for your worthless life!"
4291,@2294,I’m not worthless! Hiss!!!!
4292,@4288,Shut up! Grr!
4293,@2294,@4275
4294,@2294,@4276

4303,@2294,@4285
4304,@2294,@4286
4305,@2870,There’s nothing sadder than seeing a hard-won product depreciate!
4306,@2870,Go and collect some of that Dark Witch’s hair.
4307,@2870,"Once you’re done, hurry back to me."
4308,@2870,You can use the Incense of Darkness to preserve the hair’s magic.
4309,@2870,I was in the middle of speaking to a customer. Don’t mind him.
4310,@2870,Use the Incense of Darkness to preserve the hair’s magic.
4311,Dark Witch,Who?! Who dares harm one of our sisters?
4312,Mancini,Oh! Kutcher! Your business partner must be quite skilled.
4313,@2870,Have a look! They’re strong enough to hunt Dark Witches!
4314,Kilbanus,"Finally. You may have tried to hide your coven in the Ivory Tower, but your time is up!"
4315,Eye of Darkness,Found it! I’ll deal with it quickly!
4316,@4312,Just as expected! We’ve prepared for just this.
4317,@4312,Do your best!
4318,@4314,Hey! Thief! Give me back my stuff!
4319,@2870,@4305
4320,@2870,@4306

4326,@4312,@4312
4327,@2870,@4313
4328,@2289,Hang it over there on the drying rack.
4329,Timak Orc Berserker,Oh! Leech meat! This is great!
4330,@2289,Meow? This is dangerous! They’re aiming for the leech!
4331,@4329,"Don’t take this personally, but I can’t let you live!"
4332,@2289,Did you hear? They’re really wicked!
4333,@2289,I have a bad feeling about these tremors...
4334,@2289,Whoa! What is that? Help me! Run!
4335,@2289,We have our hands full with the Orc thieves! This is a big problem!
4336,@2289,No! This is our chance! Let’s catch that big one and guarantee some profit for ourselves!
4337,@2289,This crisis is our chance! Hang in there!
4338,@2289,@4328
4339,@4329,@4329
4340,@2289,@4330
4341,@4329,@4331
4342,@2289,@4332
4343,@2437,Those damn bandits...
4344,@2437,They’ve resisted the oppression of the Ivory Tower Wizards.
4345,@2437,We can’t look down on them.
4346,@2437,This way!
4347,@2437,It’s dangerous to stay. Let’s get out of here!
4348,Bandit Shaman,It’s them! I knew they were bad guys!
4349,@2437,Hmm. My goodness! Run away!
4350,@2437,Hmm? I think they dropped something. Will you look around?
4351,Saraxia,Hahaha! Stupid Oel Mahum!
4352,@4351,How long did you think you could contain me for?
4353,@2437,W-what is that? Something jumped out!
4354,@4351,"Huh? You’re not an Oel Mahum! Well, no matter! You must be an enemy as well!"
4355,@2437,Be careful! He looks dangerous!
4356,@2437,@4343
4357,@2437,@4344
4358,@2437,@4345
4359,@2437,@4346
4360,@2437,@4347
4361,@4348,@4348
4362,@2437,@4349
4363,@2442,Be careful. They’re no pushovers.
4364,@2442,Bring me their equipment.
4365,@2442,Don’t let your guard down. This is their territory.
4366,@2442,That equipment! It seems... special.
4367,Paska,"Hey, you! That equipment’s reserved for Oel Mahum use ONLY!"
4368,@4367,Get your filthy hands off it!
4369,@2442,@4363
4370,@2442,@4364
4371,@2442,@4365
4372,Kirinaldo,I’m getting ready to go outside and see Dorothy...
4373,@4372,I passed out when I was teleported out of the tower.
4374,@4372,I could’ve been eaten by a Grendel!
4375,@4372,Thank you for saving me.
4376,@2318,Hey! Are you close by? I think I’m in just a touch of danger!
4377,Durticlo,Roar!
4378,@4372,Dorothy! Dorothy is in danger!
4379,@2318,Popularity isn’t always a good thing! Aren’t you going to help me?
4380,@4372,@4372
4381,@4372,I passed out when I was teleported out of the tower.
4382,@4372,@4374
4383,@4372,@4375
4384,@160,"Thankfully, this is a curse I can deal with."
4385,@160,But even I can’t be sure if we delay any longer!
4386,Bandit Rookie,Who’s there?
4387,@4386,Huh? A thief? Wow! I am absolutely lost for words!
4388,@4386,"You sure are bold, stealing from bandits!"
4389,@112,Over there! Let’s get those guys too!
4390,@112,This way! Hurry! Theodore is waiting!
4391,Bandit Looter,Captain! It’s them!
4392,Bandit Looter Captain,Gasp! In all the time I’ve been a bandit - this is a first!
4393,@4392,Bandits steal! They aren’t stolen from!
4394,@4391,"Just you watch, you thieves! I’ll steal from you!"
4395,@112,We don’t have time for this...
4396,@112,Do you want to die?!
4397,@511,What brings you here? What reason?
4398,@511,You’re chasing after the Dark Brotherhood?
4399,@511,I’m not sure what this has to do with us being attacked...
4400,@511,But we can think about that after we save our friends.
4401,@511,Steal the armor from the Bandit Plunderer?
4402,@511,"This is fun, isn’t it?"
4403,@511,Let’s go before more come!
4404,Hamsen,Help! I’m trapped.
4405,Bandit Plunderer,What are you doing to my prisoner? Get your hands off!
4406,@4404,Hey! I’m not an object! How rude!
4407,@4404,"Hey... Edina, what’s that smell?"
4408,@511,That’s rude to ask! And it hardly matters right now!
4409,Lonardo,"Here, over here!"
4410,@4348,Nice. Let’s grab and sell these guys too!
4411,@4409,"We won’t be caught a second time, you fools!"
4412,Lowren,Stop! Who’s there?
4413,@511,Let’s take care of this before he calls his minions!
4414,@511,Oh no! We’re too late!
4415,@4412,Oh! It’s you from the Ivory Tower! You’ve made a mistake.
4416,@4412,Perfect! I’ve always wanted to wreck you!
4417,Bandit Chore Person,Huh? There’s a fire! Fire!!!
4418,@511,You want to know why the treasure has caught fire?
4419,@511,I can’t tell you... but it’s Ivory Tower Arcane Magic.
4420,@4417,Fire! Fire!!!
4421,@4417,Put the fire out now!
4422,@4417,Huh? Who are you guys?
4423,@4417,@1759
4424,Bandit Fighter,Argh! A fire? We’re all done for if the boss finds out about this!
4425,@4417,They seem to have lit the fire!
4426,@4348,Boss! It’s a real fire!
4427,Igorasi,Everyone! Put out the fire! Now!
4428,@4427,Who are you? Are you the one causing a ruckus in our base?
4429,@4427,What’s your deal?! You’re not even an Ivory Tower Wizard!
4430,@4427,Anyone who helps the Ivory Tower Wizard will die!
4431,@4348,Intruder! The boss has fallen!
4432,Lakasi,What?! Hold them tight until I get there!
4433,@511,"Sheesh, you guys catch on quick!"
4434,@4404,Huff huff. A little bit slower... Argh!
4435,@511,I’ll be there to help soon.
4787,@160,So the Bandit Stronghold wasn't just attacked...
4788,@160,They were completely conquered...
4436,@160,Hardin said our first priority is to help the Ivory Tower Wizard.
4437,@160,... ... ...
4438,@160,I don’t think Hardin’s judgment is wrong...
4439,@160,But he doesn’t seem to be paying much attention to finding Molly...
4440,@1597,Doesn’t this guy seem pretty useful?
4441,@1597,Atrox’s shell will make the good-luck charm stronger.
4442,@1597,The Dark Witches and the Ivory Tower are known to have a bad relationship.
4443,@1597,"Well, I don’t think anyone in the area would like Ivory Tower Wizards."
4444,@1597,They’ve always used their magic to rule this place with an iron fist.
4445,Dark Witch Prison Guard,You’re in cahoots with the Ivory Tower Wizards!
4446,@4445,Sisters! I smell a rat!
4447,Bayona,The Timak Orcs and Dark Witches are also known to have a bad relationship.
4448,@4447,But they’ve formed an alliance against the Ivory Tower.
4449,Sechalla,"As promised, these two are now yours."
4450,Bulvarak,We are quite pleased with our alliance! Krrr!
4451,@4450,They’ll be a great sacrifice! Krrr!
4452,@4450,Krr. What’s their deal? Unwelcome guests?
4453,@4449,Catch them alive! Otherwise they’re worthless!
4454,@4450,Why don’t you go back and wait? Krrr. There is no change to the trade conditions.
4455,@4449,"Sure thing, Bulvarak."
4456,@1597,"Hmm.. well, one thing’s going right! The Orcs are retreating!"
4457,@4449,What a big mouth you have. Can you defeat our sisters?
4458,@4449,Fools! To think you all would come here on your own accord.
4459,@4449,I expected a Wizard would be smarter.
4460,@4449,I guess they’re not too bad!
4461,@4449,What are you supposed to be? The Ivory Tower’s dogs?
4462,@1597,They’re pretty strong - keep your guard up!
4463,@1597,I thought the Dark Witches and Timak Orcs hated each other.
4464,@1597,Since when do they get along?
4465,@4447,I overheard something while I was captured...
4466,@4447,"It seems the Timak Orcs, Dark Witches, and the Bandits have formed an alliance."
4467,@1597,Against who?
4468,Timak Orc Prison Guard,We have an escapee! Krrr! Get them!
4469,@4260,You’re in league with those Ivory Tower fools!
4470,@160,We’ve come to see your cowardly leader!
4471,@160,We hear your leader is a coward who goes knock-kneed in front of that Dark Elf woman!
4472,Grimstone,I thought Wizards were supposed to be smart. Perhaps you’re an exception!
4473,@160,"It’s you, you cowardly Orc!"
4474,@4472,I am not a coward! You insulted me! You’re done for!
4475,@4447,"Thank you, Theodore! Best of luck to you!"
4476,@4260,Grab him! Intruder!
4477,@160,I’ll deal with them all at once.
4478,@160,Hyaaaaah!
4479,@160,"Hurry, let’s search the inside! Valter’s already left."
4480,@1597,Finish checking here and then follow Theodore.
4481,Timak Orc Elite Ranger,This way! We found them! Krrr!
4482,@4112,How dare you attack us! Krr!!!
4483,@1597,They’re incredibly upset!
4484,@160,Don’t be startled. We’re stronger than them.
4485,@4112,That’s funny! Krr! You puny twig!
4486,Avakar,"Move! Out of the way, fools! What are you doing?"
4487,Timak Orc Officer,Krrr! Avakar! We were just about to deal with the situation...
4488,@4486,"Quiet, you useless fool! Didn’t I tell you to strike enemies with full force?"
4489,@4486,"Don’t underestimate your enemies! Everyone, attack!"
4490,@1597,There’s something different about these guys!
4491,@160,Haha! Do you think so?
4492,@4486,Don’t let them live! Kill them all!
4493,@160,They have no idea how strong their enemies are!
4494,@1597,"That’s reassuring, isn’t it? Hmm... I wonder why I’m such a burden. Argh!"
4495,Timak Orc Technician,YOU! You broke my bomb!
4496,@160,Is there a battle there? Help me after you deal with it!
4497,@1597,Theodore? We need to clean up this situation quickly.
4498,Timak Orc Top-grade Warrior,This is perfect! I needed some meat to give to the wolves!
4499,Timak Orc Wolf,Krrr!
4500,@1597,Argh! They’re quite aggressive!
4501,@1597,The wolves are coming!
4502,@1597,The wolves are faster than us.
4503,@160,We won’t be able to pass until we deal with all the wolves.
4504,@255,Those stubborn Silverlight Mercenaries! I’m so sick of them!
4505,@160,"Elizabeth, how could you be so cruel?"
4506,@255,That’s a stupid question.
4507,@160,Elizabeth!
4508,@1597,"I feel reassured with you here, Hardin!"
4509,@160,I... see...
4510,Timak Orc Ranger,To think they’d follow us here! Krr!
4511,@160,"Give up, Orcs! Your leader has already surrendered."
4512,@4510,"Well, then I’m the new leader! Die!!! Krrr!"
4513,@160,Talking’s getting us nowhere.
4514,@160,We have to get to the Ivory Tower. Defeat these Orcs and clear the path!
4515,@160,I don’t remember it feeling so ominous before...
4516,@160,"I have no intention of going against Hardin, but..."
4517,@160,We can’t waste any more time...
4518,@511,Don’t you worry! This isn’t the first time!
4519,Timak Orc Patrol,Over there! The Ivory Tower Wizards!
4520,@4519,That girl wizard is mine!
4521,@511,Huh? You stinky barbarian!
4522,@3656,How dare you sneak a peek! This should put you off your bad habit.
4523,@160,"Ambush! Everyone, prepare to fight!"
4524,@511,How did they find us?
4525,@511,How dare you do that do the dean?
4526,@160,"Calm down, Edina!"
4527,@3656,Seems the dean of the Ivory Tower doesn’t have much power...
4528,@511,Eeek! Who are you? What did you do to the dean?
4529,@3656,"It is as you saw. You will face the same fate, Wizard."
4530,@3656,My subordinates will carry out their duties to their fullest.
4531,@3656,I wonder who’ll survive this fight.
4532,@337,Roar!
4533,@160,Hey! What are you after? Are you after a Nebulite?
4534,@3656,Hehehe. I’m not sure why Elizabeth is letting you live.
4535,@160,What?
4536,@3656,"I’ll kill you for everyone’s benefit, Theodore."
4537,@3656,Enjoy the rest of your life... short as it may be. Hehehe...
4538,@511,Emerson seems to have regained his strength.
4539,@511,Let’s look for the others.
4540,Emerson,"If you want to enter the Ivory Tower,"
4541,@4540,you need two more High Wizards in addition to me.
4542,@4540,The majority of magic-powered devices have broken.
4543,@511,Huh? Is this a trap?
4544,@337,That’s correct! I knew this would work! Hehehe.
4545,@337,I’ll get to kill you now!
4546,Sosa,"You know the dean is dead, right?"
4547,@511,That’s why the Silverlight Mercenaries are trying to enter the Ivory Tower.
4548,@511,Ah. I met Emerson. He’s quite alright.
4549,@4546,That’s a relief. I wonder if we’ll have a chance with the Silverlight Mercenaries.
4550,@4546,The enemies are strong. I’m concerned whether this will only lead to more casualties...
4551,Vanuel,Getting caught is only a matter of time!
4552,@337,Find them! After them!
4553,Void Hound,Sniff sniff! Krrr!
4554,@4551,You don’t necessarily have to face them. Run away! We should join forces with our friends!
4555,@337,"That’s not the right attitude, Theodore! Where do you think you’re going?"
4556,@337,That Dark Elf wizard is Theodore! After him!
4557,@511,"Wow! You’re so popular, Theodore!"
4558,@160,They’re trying to buy some time. Defeat them quickly!
4559,Sansiro,My mission is to keep you here.
4560,@4559,"Since that’s the case, how about you hold still? Or maybe just die?"
4561,@337,"Die, Silverlight Mercenaries!"
4562,@255,"Theodore, you moron."
4563,@255,"You don’t even know what Hardin wants, right?"
4564,@160,W-what are you talking about?
4565,@255,"Ha. So you’re interested? Well, you’ll need to find me then."
4566,@255,"Well, if you want to know who wants Beleth’s return the most..."
4567,@160,.... .... ....
4568,@160,Who’s that...?
4569,@160,"What are you trying to say, Elizabeth...?"
4570,@160,I’m using detection magic to look for Elizabeth.
4571,@160,Do your best to ignore any monsters that approach us.
4572,@160,"Stop, Elizabeth!"
4573,Kazniak,Arrogant and rude! Say my name with respect!
4574,@160,"Stop acting childish, Elizabeth!"
4575,@4573,"I’ll have to teach you a lesson about manners, Dark Elf!"
4576,@160,As expected... security around the Nebulite is tight.
4577,@160,Is that why the plan is to stop the flow of magic into the Summoning Circle?
4578,@511,"Thank you, Theodore."
4579,Obsidian Gargoyle,Intruder alert! Eliminate them immediately!
4580,@511,Hmmph! Don’t you fools recognize your master?
4581,@4579,Danger! Deal with it immediately!
4582,@511,"You should’ve done this sooner, you idiots! Not to me, but to the Dark Brotherhood!"
4583,@255,You’re quick on the uptake. You want to cut off power to the magic circle?
4584,@255,"Oh? You’re not as dumb as you seem, are you?"
4585,@160,You cannot take the Nebulite! It’s too dangerous!
4586,@255,"Well, I’m sure that’s true - for idiots!"
4587,@255,I’m sure Hardin would like that to happen.
4588,@255,"I mean, he would like us to take the Nebulite."
4589,@160,That’s ridiculous!
4590,@255,"You want to bet on that, Theodore?"
4591,@255,The one who wants Beleth’s return the most...
4592,@255,Is Hardin!
4593,@160,"Nonsense! You’re insane, Elizabeth!"
4594,@255,Hahaha! Exactly the reaction I expected!
4595,@255,"Well, that’s too bad. You’ll never be able to stop us now!"
4596,@4579,"Intruder located! All Guardians, battle stations!"
4597,Ivory Tower Guardian,Kill the intruders!
4598,@4546,We can’t hold out much longer! There’s too many of them! How long until we can escape?
4599,@511,Shriek!
4600,@4551,Damn! The spell has broken!
4601,@160,Argh! Don’t give up! We still have time!
4602,@4551,No! There are more coming!
4603,@160,Focus!
4604,@511,Hard to focus when we’re being attacked!
4605,@4546,Huff! Huff! I can’t hold on much... longer...
4606,@4551,Damn! Is this how I die...? Argh!
4607,@695,We’re almost there! Look! The hunters’ campsite!
4608,@695,Huff... Huff...
4609,@695,R-run! Hurry!
4610,Hunter,W-what’s going on?
4611,@695,Has something happened?
4612,@695,
4613,@4610,S-stop them!
4614,@4610,Argh!
4615,@4610,W-what is this?
4753,@4610,N-no... S-save us!
4616,@3551,"That over there is the impregnable fortress, the Town of Oren!"
4617,@552,Stop!
4618,@3559,The traitors of Oren have shown up on their own accord!
4619,@3559,
4620,@3551,What? Traitors? What are you talking about?
4621,@3559,"You heard me correctly, Steiner."
4622,@3559,We all know you betrayed Oren and murdered the first lady!
4623,@3559,C-Christine?
4624,@3559,I see there are Giran informants with you!
4625,@3559,What? Informants?
4626,@195,"No, Russel! Hold on!"
4627,@3559,Guards! Arrest them immediately!
4789,@3551,Christine!
4790,@3551,Prepare yourself!
4791,@3551,This is the end for you!
4792,@3551,Argh!
4793,Salein,S-Steiner!
4794,@3559,There’s no need to hide this anymore!
4795,@4125,The prisoners are getting away!
4796,@160,"Oh no, it’s too late! Ugh! What a mess!"
4797,Barka Silenos,How are you guys?
4798,@4797,Don’t you dare act arrogant! Get them!
4799,@3656,Back off.
4800,@160,A-argh... Is everyone alright?
4801,@195,W-what’s going on? What happened?
4802,@160,These guys sure aren’t pushovers. Careful!
4639,Squire,Argh... Damn them!
4640,@160,Now! Take this!
4641,@3656,Get out of the way!
4642,@3656,I’ll hand it back to you!
4643,Mercenaries,
4644,@160,
4645,@3656,We’ve been delayed.
4646,@4639,
4647,@3651,No... Don’t do this...
4648,@3651,
4649,Oel Mahum Shaman,You’re all rats in a hole.
4650,@160,Is that a sentry? They’ve spotted us!
4651,@160,@1714
4652,@160,"Show yourselves, minions of darkness!"
4653,@160,It’s them!
4654,@160,@1827
4655,@186,Just as expected of Theodore!
4657,@3422,Argh! Get rid of them!
4659,Grandis Berserker,
4660,@160,Hurry and activate the barrier device!
4661,Oel Mahum,Destroy them all!!!
4662,@493,They’re coming!!!
4663,@160,Ugh... Not enough... Mana...
4664,@3651,"I’ll help, too!"
4665,@195,We’re almost here! Hang in there!
4666,@337,Did you think you could get away so easily?
4667,@195,Pan! I’ll trust you with him!
4668,@186,H-how can you do this to me?
4669,@186,R-run!!!
4670,@3651,Uh... Wait!
4671,@186,Don’t follow me!
4672,@186,Whoa! That’s incredible!
4673,@195,Tsk... this situation isn’t good...
4674,@195,"Hey, look here. I’ll spare your life if you head back."
4675,@337,"I think you’re going to be the one to die, don’t you?"
4676,@337,@1806
4677,@255,You useless simpletons! Do I really have to take matters into my own hands?
4678,@195,Argh! Elizabeth!!!
4679,@255,"Nothing will change, even if you bother us."
4680,@255,Bring back that girl.
4681,Ivory Tower Wizard 1,Shut up and listen.
4682,@4681,We’re done for the moment we step through that door.
4683,@4681,"When I give you the signal, follow the plan."
4684,@4681,"Three, two, one... Now!"
4685,@4681,Now! Hurry!
4686,Ivory Tower Wizard 2,Mana Shield!
4687,@4686,I can’t hold on anymore!
4688,@4681,Almost done! Just a little more!
4689,@4686,We’re at our limit!
4690,@4681,Nice! We’re done!
4691,@4681,Meteor Shower!
4692,@4681,It’s time! Run!
4693,@255,You dumb Orcs! Can’t you do your jobs properly?
4694,Ivory Tower Wizard 3,You’re in cahoots with the ambushers!
4695,@255,I guess Embrion isn’t as great as I thought since you imbeciles were able to escape!
4696,@255,
4697,@255,
4698,@255,I’ll deal with you myself.
4699,@4686,R-run!
4700,@4694,
4701,@1323,We finally caught you!
4702,@1323,Rip them to shreds!
4703,@160,Oh no... Is this it for me...
4704,@1323,@2300
4705,@431,Is everyone okay? I’m glad I’m not too late.
4706,Ivory Tower Dean,@2227
4707,@337,Now! Hit them hard!
4708,@4706,Thunder Storm!
4709,@3656,Not bad. As expected from a dean.
4710,@3656,
4711,@3656,I was just thinking that magic users must be worthless since we were able to conquer the Ivory Tower so easily.
4712,@3656,
4713,Ivory Tower Wizard 1,Worthless? How dare you!
4714,@4706,
4715,@3656,Oh my. My apologies. That was quite rude of me.
4716,@3656,
4717,@4706,"Embrion, what are you planning?"
4718,@4706,
4719,@3656,"Oh, not much."
4720,@3656,But I couldn’t come empty handed.
4721,@4706,The m-mana!
4722,@3656,I hope you enjoy my gift...
4723,@3656,Who’s there?
4724,@160,Wait! Elizabeth!
4725,@160,
4726,@255,"There’s no use, Theodore. I’ve already set up a barrier."
4727,@255,
4728,@160,Stop!
4729,@160,You’re dangerous because you know the secret of the Giants!
4730,@160,
4731,@255,"Shut up, Theodore! You don’t even understand the situation you’re in."
4732,@255,
4733,@3656,Stop!
4734,@3656,Beleth is waiting.
4735,@255,That requires no reply.
4736,@255,
4737,@3656,"Theodore, know this... I must defeat him. For her sake."
4738,@160,@4724
4739,@160,No!
4740,@511,Theodore! Is it time yet?
4741,@4540,The mana is starting to run low.
4742,@160,Just a bit more... Hang on a bit longer!
4743,@4540,Theodore! It’s dangerous!
4744,@431,I see it’s not too late. Is everyone alright?
4745,Theodore & Edina,Oh no.
4746,@4661,How dare a Wizard try to steal our product!
4747,@4661,@1806
4748,@160,They’ll come swarming soon!
4749,@160,"There’s no time! Hurry, run!"
4750,@160,I’ll make sure they can’t follow us!
4751,@511,We’re okay now.
4752,@160,It’s too early to feel relieved. We have to keep moving.
4810,@2318,I hear it’s two apples’ worth of Adena...
4811,@2318,Ugh... I wanna cry...
4812,@4386,Huh? What’s this guy doing on our turf?
4813,@4386,Shoo! Shoo! Bug off!
4814,@4386,We didn’t steal anything! I mean - we didn’t steal anything THIS TIME!
4815,@2318,Where are you? I’m in front of the tent.
4816,@4391,Hey! You messed with the kid - now you’ve gotta mess with me!
4817,@2318,Did you guys steal my money?
4818,@4391,This is a stick-up. Hand over everything you’ve got!
4819,@2318,Is that how you’re going to be?
4820,@4386,"Hey, you there! Stop!"
4821,@2318,What’s your problem? What dumpster did you crawl out of?
4822,Kayteach,Me no dirty! You insult me! You gonna pay!
4823,@4386,You think I’m just going to stand here and take a beating? Now it’s your turn! Hahaha!
4824,@2318,"Ugh, what a bunch of lowlifes. Keep the money!"
4825,@2318,Ugh! You reek! Use this to purchase your one-way ticket to hell!
4826,@2219,What good’s a Watcher who can’t tell friend from foe?
4827,@2219,I can’t believe I had to hide every time I come through here.
4828,@2219,Take that and I’m sure the Ivory Tower will loosen up on their accusations.
4829,@2219,It’s quite a valuable item to someone who knows how to use it.
4830,Barrier Watchman,Support requested! Serious crime detected.
4831,@2219,What’s that? You’re finally ready to do some actual work?
4832,@4830,Criminal offense committed. Watcher body damaged.
4833,@4830,You will be killed if you resist arrest.
4834,@2219,Whoa! Slow down! There’s no need for that!
4835,Gallonian,Argh! What is wrong with you?!
4836,@4835,Do you have any idea how hard I worked on this?
4837,@2219,Is he not from the Dark Brotherhood? My goodness...
4838,@4835,"Without those, the Golems will be useless. They can’t even be recycled!"
4839,@4835,"Return that to me this instant, you thief!"
4840,@2219,I find you calling me a thief quite ridiculous.
4841,,You have been invited to join a new clan. Check the Clan Menu for details.
4842,,Your journey isn’t over yet! Check the Journey Quest for details.
4934,Zaken Pirates Hammerfist,The escapee! Catch him!
4935,@934,There are others! Catch them as well!
4843,@2648,"You guys are the Silverlight Mercenaries! Help me out, will you?"
4844,@2648,Keys. You need keys! Check the desk over there!
4845,@2648,"Actually, we didn’t tell you about the mission of our Advance Party."
4846,@2648,"We’re looking for
the missing countess of Giran,
Trisha."
4847,@2648,Typical pirates! They blocked the road!
4848,@2648,Let’s talk after we clean up this trash pile.
4849,@2648,Word is that she was recently seen at the harbor.
4850,@2648,"So we followed that lead here, but only found her diary."
4851,@2648,"Those darn pirates must have abducted her.
They must be trying to eliminate anyone who might get in their way!"
4852,@2648,"Darn it!
For better or for worse,
it’s just a Leech Egg!"
4853,@2648,"Be careful of
their mucus!"
4854,@2648,"Ugh...
 Be careful!
 Leonard is no chump!"
4855,Leonard,"I can already
smell the sweet
scent of blood!"
4856,@4855,"How about I rip him to shreds
and taste his blood?"
4857,@2648,"Ugh... are you all okay?
Come over here for a moment."
4858,@2648,"Please...
Bring the Baron and his soldiers
here safely!"
4859,Zaken Pirates Lookout,"Huh?
How did they get here?!"
4860,Douglas,"Search the ship
thoroughly!"
4861,@4860,"If you don’t want
to be Kraken food,
you better hurry it up!"
4862,@4860,"If they come,
I’ll call you.
When I do, you better be quick!!"
4863,@967,"5 minutes.
Just hold on for 5 more minutes!
Trisha!!!"
4864,Trisha,"I’ll try,
I’ll try my best.
Zaken!"
4865,@4864,"Scoundrels.
You killed Leonard
to get here, didn’t you?"
4866,@4864,"You killed my Guardian Knight.
I guess you’ll
have to take his place!"
4867,@4855,Did you think you could get away?
4868,@4855,I wonder what color your blood is. Let’s see!
4869,@4855,Argh... I... need blood!
4892,@4864,Go away! Leave!
4893,@4864,No!!! I... I can’t die yet!
4894,@4864,"Die! All of you, die!"
4895,@967,"We’ve arrived!
Keep your hands off of Trisha! Scum!"
4929,Zaken Pirates Boatswain,Intruder! Catch the intruder!
4930,@4860,"They’re here!
Hurry up!"
4870,Ramog’s Guard Grenadier,"Intruders! Must destroy!
Bombs! Must throw!"
4871,Ramog’s Guard,"Oh, Great Ramog!
Those who interrupt the ritual must die!"
4872,Ramog’s Royal Guard,"Intruder! Intruder alert!
Repeat! Intruders!"
4873,Lunatic Self-destructing Soldier,"Persistent fools!
I’ll self-destruct!
We all die!"
4874,Laenis,"Hello! Is anybody there?!
I don’t care if you’re an orc,
please just save me!"
4875,@4874,"Be careful!
That orc
is a Guard Captain here!"
4876,Boranta,"Why are you
humans here?"
4877,@4876,"Kill all those
who cannot
be sacrificed!"
4878,@4874,"Hey there!
Did you forget about me?
Please get me out of here!"
4879,@4874,"Paagrio’s strength
is enough to
rival the gods!"
4880,@4874,"If these crazy orcs
acquire that power...
Oh no..."
4881,@4874,"It’s a scary
thought.
We must stop them!"
4882,@4874,"This way!
We must hurry!"
4883,@4874,"We can escape
as soon as we get rid of this."
4884,@4874,"If you follow this road
a cave with an altar
will appear!"
4885,Ramog,"Humans!
What is stupid Boranta
doing?"
4886,@4885,"No.
It’s actually better.
The power of Paagrio..."
4887,@4885,"I’ll test this out
on you.
You should feel honored!"
4888,@4876,"Now, it’s your turn!"
4889,@4876,"If you get hit alone,
it is going to hurt!"
4890,@4876,Bug off!
4891,@4876,Boom! Wahahaha!
4896,@4876,@4888
4897,@4885,@1420
4898,@4885,This is Paagrio’s power!
4899,@4885,Wahahaha!
4900,@4885,Death will soon be upon you...!
4901,@4885,Paagrio! Give me strength!
4902,@4876,"You fools!
What are my guards doing?!
Help me!"
4903,@4876,"Gahhh!
Archers! Bring out all my archers!
Eliminate these fools!"
4904,@4876,"What... what the!
Gahh! I fight to the death!
Self-destructing soldiers, attack!"
4905,@4876,"If only Ramog can acquire the power of Paagrio...!
You would... ugh!"
4906,@4885,"Don’t think this is over...!
There will be even more orcs in the future...!
When that day comes, you will fall. There will be no hope! Wahahaha!"
4907,Defense Device,Intruder alert. Intruder alert.
4908,@4907,Self-defense mechanisms activated. Self-defense mechanisms activated.
4909,@4907,Intruder targeting configured. Eliminate all intruders.
4910,@104,I knew they’d have crazy technology.
4911,@104,It seems they have been researching and developing these weapons.
4912,@104,A weapon that uses souls to increase strength and battle the gods...
4913,@104,So much research and testing were required to create this ultimate weapon.
4914,@104,How could they treat living humans as lab rats?
4915,@104,Oh no! Hardin is in the midst of battle!
4916,@431,Careful! They are stronger than they look!
4922,@104,The barrier on the guard unit has been removed!
4923,@104,We can attack now!
4924,@4885,Can you dodge this?!
4925,@4885,It won’t be easy this time around!
4926,@4885,Oh Paagrio! Finish the job!
4927,Leewen,"I’ve tried
to infiltrate many times,"
4928,@4927,"but I failed every time
because of the signal fires
somewhere inside the village."
4931,@4870,"How dare you!
If you go to the guard post
Boranta will be mad!"
4932,@4870,"If Captain Boranta
is Mad!
We all die!"
4933,@4874,"God of light,
Shower me with
the power of purification!"
4936,@4876,How dare you refuse the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be Ramog’s sacrifice!
4937,@4876,You deserve to die!
4938,@4876,Boom!
4939,@4876,Not bad!
4940,@4885,Now the ritual preparations are complete.
4941,@4885,All you shamans always object!
4942,@4885,Always saying not to awaken the power of Paagrio!
4943,@4885,"Now, I’ll use your blood to awaken Paagrio’s power!"
4944,@4885,I’ll drag you out!
4945,@4885,"So, this is Paagrio’s power!"
4946,@4885,This is the beginning of my world!
4947,@4855,W-what’s that?
4948,@4855,"You’re the Guardian Knight, Leonard?!"
4949,@4855,What in the world is this?
4950,@4855,This is nothing personal.
4951,@4855,"I’ll need you to let go of your sword.
I don’t want unnecessary attention brought upon this place!"
4952,@4855,"Now, over there!"
4953,Alert,Boss! Boss!!!
4954,@4953,What is it?
4955,@4953,Intruders! Intruders have appeared!
4956,@4953,What? You idiot! You took this long to tell me that?!
4957,@4953,Boss!
4958,@4953,"Everyone, get up!"

4960,@4864,Zaken.
4961,@4864,I’m terrified...
4962,@4864,When are you coming back...?
4963,@4864,"We’re doing our best, Trisha... Just a little bit more..."
4964,@4864,How dare you!
4965,@4864,Well... I don’t have much of a choice... I’ll do my best to hold on until Zaken arrives.
4966,@4864,Did the Lord of Giran send you?
4967,@4864,"You may already know, but I have no intention of returning."
4968,@4864,There is only one answer!
4969,@4864,You will remain here. Forever!
4970,Fairway,"Trisha, no!
Now, Zaken..."
4971,@4970,Wherever you are!
4972,@4970,"I will find you, and destroy any evidence you ever existed!"
4973,@4885,"How dare you...!
Don’t you dare attempt to stop me!"
4974,Orc Shaman,"Paagrio’s power!
It is not for
a mere Orc to have!"
4975,@4974,"This power
is too strong
for an Orc like you!"
4976,@4885,"Fools.
I will demolish
your soul!"
4977,@4885,"Arghh...
My strength...
You fools...!"
4978,@4974,"You can’t have that power!
Halt! Ramog!"
4979,@4885,"Fools...!
Do you hinder me
even in death?!"
4980,@4974,"The Nebulite Crystal!
It must be destroyed!
Hurry!"
4981,@4885,@4976
4982,@4885,"I’ll finish
you off now!
I’ll show you my true strength!"

4984,@967,Pay for your sins with your death!
4985,@967,You’ll join her soon!
4986,@967,The light is gone! There’s no hope for you now!
4987,Zaken Blood Ranger,"Oh... Oh, no! The sun is being blocked!"
4988,@4987,The sun is halfway gone!
4989,@4987,We’re doomed! The sun is almost completely gone!
5171,@2648,I don’t know what a Giran aristocrat is doing here.
5172,@2648,Show some respect.
5173,@2046,"Hey, you there! You’re smuggling, aren’t you?"
5174,@2648,W-what? What are you talking about? I am an officer of the army!
5175,@2046,We caught him red-handed! Arrest him!
5176,Sir Alexander,... ...
5177,@2648,What is this?
5178,@2648,"Don’t worry, Alexander. I’m sure this is all just a misunderstanding."
5179,@2046,I’ll send you to the gallows!
5180,@5176,Let’s go!
5181,@5176,So you’re Zaken! You... You’ve ruined everything!
5182,@5176,You’ve ruined her chance to become Aden’s Archduchess...
5183,@5176,You’ve ruined everything!
5184,Phantom of Zaken,I heard enough about you from Trisha.
5185,@5184,Do you remember abusing her when she was a child?
5186,@5184,She shudders at a mere thought of you.
5187,@5176,It’s a happy life compared to the one she would’ve suffered with you!
5188,@5184,Don’t pretend you’re doing this for her! Hypocrite!
5189,Abelino,"Watch out, Sir Alexander!"
5190,@5176,Ugh... You! What have you done to me?!
5191,@5184,I took over your body. You no longer have freedom.
5192,@5184,I will take this hypocrite away.
5193,@5184,Follow me to my flagship if you can!
5194,@5176,S-save me! My body is... Moving on its own! Help!
5195,@5189,Sir Alexander!
5196,Pirate Zombie,Whoa...
5197,@5189,It seems battle is inevitable thanks to Zaken’s minions.
5198,@5189,That was just Zaken’s phantom. His body must be somewhere else.
5199,@5189,I think he’s taken Sir Alexander hostage so that you’ll go to him.
5200,@5189,"You must be wary of the area surrounding the flagship, that’s where Zaken is waiting."
5201,@5189,"Zaken is able to create an Outworld, a world much like ours but also very different."
5202,@5189,You must take care to avoid nighttime in his realm.
5203,@5189,His power reaches its height at nightfall.
5204,@5189,Then no one is able to stop him.
5205,@5176,He’s... done something strange to me...
5206,@5189,"Oh no, Sir Alexander!"
5207,Mutated Sir Alexander,Grrr... Huh? What’s wrong with me?!
5208,@5207,"What happened to me? Zaken, you bastard!!!"
5209,@5189,"Calm yourself, please!"
5210,@5189,It looks like the mutation has made him extremely aggressive! Watch out!
5211,@5207,Hate... I hate you all! Look at me... It’s all your fault!
5212,@5207,Gahhhhhhhhhhh!!!
5213,@5189,"Please! Alexander, stop!"
5214,Zaken’s Voice,Hahahahaha....!
5215,@5189,What was that? Zaken? Where is he?
5216,@5214,Kill... then kill again! Kill each other to survive!
5217,@5214,"Even if you manage to withstand this hell, another one awaits!"
5218,@5189,We’ve become mere entertainment for Zaken to enjoy...
5219,@5189,Ugh... We can’t... go easy on this monster.
5220,@5189,We must defeat Sir Alexander no matter what!
